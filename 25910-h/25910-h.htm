<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE GLADWYNE EXPEDITION</h3>
</div>

<p>Vernon Lisle was fishing with a determination
that did not spring altogether from love
of the sport. The water of the British Columbian
river in which he stood knee-deep was icy cold;
his rubber boots were badly ripped and leaky, and he
was wet with the drizzle that drove down the lonely
valley. It was difficult to reach the slack behind a
boulder some distance outshore, and the arm he strained
at every cast ached from hours of assiduous labor;
but there was another ache in his left side which was
the result of insufficient food, and though the fish were
shy he persevered.
</p>
<p>A few hundred yards away the stream came roaring
down a long declivity in a mad white rapid and then
shot across the glassy green surface of the pool below
in a raised-up wedge of foam. Wet boulders and
outcropping fangs of rock hemmed in the water, and
among them lay stranded logs and stream-packed
masses of whitened branches. Farther back, ragged
cypresses and cedars, half obscured by the drifting
haze of spray, climbed the sides of the gorge, and
beyond rose the dim, rounded summits of treeless hills.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
There were streaks of snow on some of them, for winter
threatened to close in unusually early.
</p>
<p>With a lowering sky overhead and the daylight
beginning to fade, it was a desolate picture; one into
which the lonely figure of the man in tattered deerskin
jacket and shapeless hat somehow fitted. His attire
matched the gray-white coloring of rock and boulder;
his spare form and agile movements, together with the
intentness of his bronzed face and the steadiness of his
eyes, hinted at the quickness of observation, the stubborn
endurance, and the tireless activity, by which
alone life can be maintained in the savage North. He
had the alertness of the wild creatures of the waste;
and it was needed.
</p>
<p>All round him stretched a forbidding wilderness,
part of the great desolation which runs north from the
warmer and more hospitable thick-forest belt of British
Columbia. Indeed, this wilderness, broken by the
more level spaces between the Rockies and Lake Winnipeg,
runs right across Canada from Labrador to the
Pacific on the northern edge of the heavy-timber line.
It contains little human life&mdash;a few Hudson Bay fur-traders
and the half-breed trappers who deal with
them&mdash;and it is frozen for eight months in the year.
There are only two practicable means of traversing it&mdash;with
dog sledges on the snow, or by canoe on the
lakes and rivers in the brief summer.
</p>
<p>The water routes are difficult in British Columbia,
but Lisle and his two companions had chosen to go by
canoe, partly because the question of food is vitally
important to men cut off from all source of supply
except game, and even that is scarce in places. To
transport upon one&#8217;s back any weight of provisions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
besides tents, blankets, and other necessaries, through
a rugged country is an almost impossible task. The
men, accordingly, after relaying part of their stores,
had secured an Indian craft and had paddled and poled
her laboriously across lakes and up rivers. Now
when their provisions were running short, they were
confronted with a difficult portage round a thundering
rapid.
</p>
<p>At length Lisle, securing another trout, waded
ashore and glanced with a rueful smile at the dozen
this one made. They scarcely averaged half a pound,
and he had spent most of a day that could badly be
spared in catching them. Plodding back along the
shingle with his load, he reached a little level strip
beneath a scarp of rock, where a fire blazed among
the boulders. A tent stood beneath two or three small,
wind-stunted spruces, and a ragged man in long river-boots
lay resting on one elbow near the blaze, regardless
of the drizzle. He was a few years over thirty,
Lisle&#8217;s age, and he differed from Lisle in that something
in his appearance suggested that he was not at
home in the wilds. As a matter of fact, Nasmyth was
an adventurous English sportsman&mdash;which describes
him fairly in person and character.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not many,&#8221; he commented, glancing at the trout
Lisle laid down. &#8220;They&#8217;ll hardly carry us over to-morrow,
and I only got a couple from the canoe with
the troll. We&#8217;ve gained nothing by stopping here,
and time&#8217;s precious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A sure thing,&#8221; Lisle agreed, beginning to clean
the trout. &#8220;We&#8217;ll tackle the portage as soon as it&#8217;s
light to-morrow. Where&#8217;s Jake?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone off to look for a deer,&#8221; was the answer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
&#8220;Said he wouldn&#8217;t come back without one if he camped
on the range all night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle made no comment, but went on dexterously
with his work, while Nasmyth watched him with half-amused
admiration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re handy at that and at everything else you
do,&#8221; Nasmyth remarked at length. &#8220;In fact, you
easily beat Jake, though he&#8217;s a professional packer
and, so to speak, to the manner born.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Lisle.
</p>
<p>It was growing dark, but the coppery glow of the
fire fell upon his face, emphasizing the strong coloring
of his weather-darkened skin. On the whole, it
was a prepossessing face, clearly cut&mdash;indeed, it was
a trifle thin&mdash;with a hint of quiet determination in
the clear gray eyes and firm mouth. He looked capable
of resolute action and, when it was needed, of
Spartan self-denial. There was no suggestion of anything
sensual, or even of much regard for bodily comfort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind my being a little personal,
I&#8217;d better own that I suspected the fact you mention,
and it puzzled me,&#8221; Nasmyth replied. &#8220;You
see, when I first met you at the Empress Hotel, in Victoria,
you were dressed and talked like the usual prosperous
business man. Trafford, who introduced us,
said that you had a good deal of money in some of the
Yukon mines.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trafford was quite right. The point is that I
took a part in locating two of the claims. Before
that I followed a good many rough occupations,
mostly in the bush. My prosperity&#8217;s recent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth still looked curious, and Lisle smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can guess your thoughts&mdash;I don&#8217;t speak altogether
like a bushman? Well, my father was an Englishman,
and my mother a lady of education from
Montreal; that was why, at the cost of some self-denial
on their part, I was sent East to school.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was an incomplete explanation. He had inherited
the Englishman&#8217;s reticence, which forbade him to
point out that his father sprang from an old family
of standing and had, for some reason which his son
had never learned, quarreled bitterly with his English
relatives. Coming to Canada, he had married and
taken up the bush life on a small and unremunerative
ranch, where he had died and left his widow and his son
badly provided for.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; responded Nasmyth; and Lisle supposed
it was in recognition of the fact that he would
hardly have furnished even those few particulars to
one whom he regarded as a stranger. &#8220;To reciprocate,
a few words will make clear all there is to know
about me. English public school, Oxford afterward&mdash;didn&#8217;t
take a degree. Spend most of my time in
the country, though I make a few sporting trips
abroad when I can afford it and have nothing better
to do. That partly explains this journey. But I
haven&#8217;t tried to force your confidence, nor offered you
mine, altogether casually.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I supposed,&#8221; returned Lisle. &#8220;It strikes me
that since we got near the Gladwyne expedition&#8217;s line
of march we have both felt that some explanation is
needed. To go back a little, when I met you in Victoria
and you offered to join me in the trip, I agreed
partly because I wanted an intelligent companion, but
I had another reason. At first I supposed you wished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
to go because a journey through a rough and little-known
country seems to appeal to one kind of Englishman,
but I changed my mind when you showed
your anxiety to get upon the Gladwyne party&#8217;s trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were right. I knew the Gladwynes in England;
the one who died was an old and valued friend
of mine. I could give you the history of their march,
though I hardly think that&#8217;s needful. You seem remarkably
well acquainted with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle&#8217;s face hardened. With the exception of one
man, he knew more than anybody else about the fatal
journey a party of four had made a year earlier
through the region he and Nasmyth were approaching.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a cause for it; but I&#8217;ll
ask you to tell me what you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He threw more branches on the fire and a crackling
blaze sprang aloft, forcing up the ragged spruce
boughs out of the surrounding gloom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the survivor&#8217;s narrative. I heard it from
his own lips more than once,&#8221; began Nasmyth. &#8220;I
dare say most of it&#8217;s a kind of story that&#8217;s not unusual
in the North.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one that has been repeated with local variations
over and over again. But go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were two Gladwynes&mdash;cousins. George,
the elder of the two, was a man of means and position;
Clarence, the younger, had practically nothing&mdash;two
or three hundred pounds a year. They were both
sportsmen&mdash;George was a bit of a naturalist&mdash;and
they made the expedition with the idea of studying
the scarcer game. Well, their provisions were insufficient;
an Indian packer deserted them; they were delayed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
here and there; and when they reached the river
that we are making for they were badly worn out and
winter was closing in. Knowing it was dangerous to
go any farther, they started down-stream to strike
their outgoing trail, but not long afterward they
wrecked their canoe in a rapid and lost everything except
a few pounds of provisions. To make things
worse, George had fallen from a slippery rock at the
last portage and badly hurt his leg. After making
a few leagues with difficulty, he found he could go no
farther, and they held a council. They were already
suffering from want of food, but their guide estimated
that by a forced march overland they might reach a
place where some skin-hunters were supposed to be
camped. There was a Hudson Bay post farther away.
On coming up they had cached some provisions in
two places on opposite sides of the river&mdash;they kept
crossing to pole through the easiest slack. George
accordingly insisted that the others go on; each was
to follow a different bank and the first to find the provisions
was to try to communicate with the other and
hurry back with food. If they were unable to locate
the caches they were to leave the river and push on in
search of help. They agreed; but deep snow had
fallen and Clarence Gladwyne failed to find the cache.
He reached the hunters&#8217; camp famishing, and they
went back with him. He found his cousin dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the guide?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather an ugly story. You must have heard
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard the one Gladwyne told in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The guide reached the Hudson Bay post&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
longer journey than the one Gladwyne made&mdash;in the
last stage of exhaustion. He had taken very little
food with him&mdash;Gladwyne knew exactly how much&mdash;and
the Hudson Bay agent decided that it was impossible
he could have covered the distance on the minute
quantity. There was only one inference.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That he had found the cache?&#8221; Lisle&#8217;s face
grew very stern.
</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, there was some slight excuse for him.
Think of it&mdash;a worn-out, famishing man, without
blankets or means of making a fire, who had struggled
over icy rocks and through leagues of snow, finding
a few cans of provisions and a little moldy flour!
Even when he had satisfied his hunger, he was, no
doubt, unequal to making the return journey to rejoin
a man who was probably already dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that man had found a scrap of food, he would
have tried!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle&#8217;s voice had a curious ring in it, and Nasmyth
looked at him hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem convinced.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am; I knew him well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth was startled and he showed it, but afterward
he looked thoughtful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I understand,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>For a minute or two there was silence which was
broken only by the snapping of the branches on the
fire and the hollow roar of the rapid. The latter had
a curious, irritating effect on Nasmyth, who hitherto
had scarcely noticed the insistent pulsatory clamor.
At length Lisle spoke again, laying a strong restraint
upon himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our mutual friend called me Lisle at the Empress
Hotel. I don&#8217;t think he mentioned my first name,
Vernon; and as that was the name of Gladwyne&#8217;s guide
I kept it in the background. I was anxious to take
you with me; I wanted an Englishman of some standing
in the old country whose word would be believed.
What was more, I wanted an honest man who would
form an unbiased opinion. I didn&#8217;t know then that you
were a friend of Gladwyne&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth made a slight gesture which suggested the
acknowledgment of a compliment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to be just&mdash;it&#8217;s sometimes hard.&#8221; His
voice had a throb of pain in it as he went on: &#8220;I
was the friend of George Gladwyne&mdash;the one who
perished. I had a strong regard for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Something in his expression hinted that this regard
had not been shared by the Gladwyne who survived.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When my father first came out to British Columbia,
new to the bush ways,&#8221; Lisle resumed, &#8220;a
neighbor, Vernon, was of great help to him&mdash;lent
him teams, taught him how to chop, and what cattle
to raise. He died before my father, and I was named
for him; but he left a son, older than I, who grew
up like him&mdash;I believe he was the finest chopper and
trailer I have ever come across. He died, as you have
heard, from exposure and exhaustion, a few days
after he reached the Hudson Bay post&mdash;before he
could clear himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle broke off for a moment and seemed to have
some difficulty in continuing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When my father died, Vernon took charge of the
ranch, at my mother&#8217;s request&mdash;I was rather young
and she meant to launch me in some profession. Vernon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
had no ambition&mdash;he loved the bush&mdash;and he
tried to give me enough to finish my education while he
ran both ranches with a hired man. I think my
mother never suspected that he handed her over more
than she was entitled to, but I found it out and I&#8217;ve
been glad ever since that I firmly prevented his continuing
the sacrifice. For all that, I owe him in many
ways more than I could ever have repaid.&#8221; He
clenched one hand tight as he concluded: &#8220;I can at
least clear his memory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded in sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You called me an honest man; you have my word&mdash;I&#8217;ll
see the right done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Quietly as it was spoken, Lisle recognized that it
was no light thing his companion promised him. In
the Dominion, caste stands by caste, and Lisle, having
seen and studied other Englishmen of his friend&#8217;s description,
knew that the feeling was stronger in the
older country. To expose a man of one&#8217;s own circle
to the contempt and condemnation of outsiders is, in
any walk of life, a strangely repugnant thing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to-morrow we&#8217;ll pull out and
portage across the divide to strike the Gladwynes&#8217;
trail. And now I&#8217;ll fry the trout and we&#8217;ll have supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They let the subject drop by tacit agreement during
the meal, and soon after it was over a shout from
the crest of the ridge above, followed by a smashing
of underbrush, announced that their packer was making
for the camp. Lisle answered, and a cry came
down:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a deer, and there are duck on the lake ahead!
We&#8217;ll try for some as we go up!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>Nasmyth&#8217;s smile betokened deep satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a weight off my mind,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
smoke one pipe, and then I think I&#8217;ll go to sleep.
We&#8217;ll make a start with the first loads as soon as it&#8217;s
light enough.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE DIVIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>Dawn was late the next morning; the light
crept slowly through bitter rain, and when
Lisle and his companions had breakfasted
sumptuously for the first time during several days it
was with reluctance that they broke camp. Indeed,
Nasmyth would have suggested remaining under shelter
only that he had come to accept Lisle&#8217;s decision
as final and the latter was eager to push on. The
blacktail deer would not last them long; the trout
were getting shyer every day with the increasing cold;
they were a long distance from the nearest settlement;
while winter was rapidly coming on.
</p>
<p>Nasmyth shouldered his load with the others, and
they set out across a strip of gravel strewn with
boulders. Here and there networks of stranded
branches had to be floundered through, and the ragged
ends rasped their dilapidated boots and bruised their
legs. Then, where the bluff rose almost precipitously
from the water, they crept along slippery ledges, or
waded through the shallower pools, with the white
rapid roaring down a few yards outshore of them.
There were places where a slip would have meant destruction,
but that was nothing unusual and time was
too precious to spend in an attempt to climb the ridge
which hemmed them in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>The pack-straps hurt Nasmyth&#8217;s shoulders&mdash;one
of them had been rubbed raw by previous loads and it
smarted painfully until he grew warm with exertion.
He was soon wet through; in places the spray drove
into his face so that he could hardly see; but he held
on with dogged determination, trying to keep up with
the others. With the exception of a few hunting
trips, his life had been smooth, and now, dressed mostly
in rags and aching in every limb, he smiled grimly as
he remembered how he had hitherto taken his pleasure.
When he had shot partridges, he had, as a rule, been
driven to such stubble or turnip fields as lay at any
distance from his residence, and he had usually been
provided with a pony when he ascended the high moors
in search of grouse. Money smoothed out many small
difficulties in the older land, but it was powerless in
the wilds of the new one, where one must depend on
such things as native courage, brute strength, and the
capacity for dogged endurance, which are common to
all ranks of men. It was fortunate for Nasmyth that
he possessed them, but that, as he was discovering, is
not quite enough. They are great gifts in the raw,
but, like most others, they need exercise and assiduous
cultivation for their full development.
</p>
<p>On reaching the head of the rapid, they went back
for another load, and afterward Jake got into the
canoe, while Lisle fixed the end of the tracking-line
about his shoulders. Aided by the line, the packer
swung the canoe across madly whirling eddies and in
and out among foam-lapped rocks, and now and then
drove her, half hidden by the leaping froth, up some
tumultuous rush. At times Lisle, wading waist-deep
and dragged almost off his feet, barely held her stationary&mdash;Nasmyth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
could see his chest heave and his
face grow darkly flushed&mdash;but in another instant
they were going on again. That a craft could be
propelled up any part of the rapid would, Nasmyth
thought, have appeared absolutely incredible to any
one who had not seen it done.
</p>
<p>At last, however, the task became too hard for them
and after dragging her out they carried her, upside
down, in turn. It was difficult for them to see where
they were going, and the craft, made from a hollowed
log, was by no means so well fitted for the work as the
bark or canvas canoe of the more eastern wilds. She
was comparatively heavy, and their heads and shoulders
were inside of her. Once or twice the portager
fell; and the fall is an awkward one, as it is impossible
to break it with one&#8217;s hands, which are occupied in
holding the canoe. Still, they made progress, and,
launching again above the rapid, they reached a lake
at noon, by hard paddling. Here they landed, and
Nasmyth dropped down upon a boulder to look about
him.
</p>
<p>It was a cheerless prospect he saw through the haze
of rain. Back into the distance ran a stretch of slate-gray
water, flecked and seamed by the white tops of
little splashing waves, for a nipping wind blew down
the lake. On either side rose low hills, dotted here
and there with somber and curiously rigid trees. They
were not large, and though from a distance they
looked much the same, Nasmyth recognized some as
spruce and supposed the other ragged spires to be
cedars. In one spot there were some that resembled
English larch, and these were almost bare.
</p>
<p>Then his companions began to discuss the best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
means of further progress. With a fresh breeze
ahead, Jake advocated poling through the shallows
near the beach; and Lisle, with a courtesy which Nasmyth
had already noticed, turned toward him when
he answered, as if his opinion might be valuable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that the beach sweeps back off the
straight. We&#8217;d drive her right up the middle to headwater
with the paddle before we&#8217;d make two-thirds of
the way poling alongshore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a good deal harder work, wouldn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; Nasmyth ventured, and laughed when he saw
Lisle&#8217;s faint amusement. &#8220;I suppose that doesn&#8217;t
count. It&#8217;s not worth mentioning,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;Since you&#8217;re anxious to get on, what&#8217;s the use of
stopping for dinner? After the breakfast I had, I
can hold out some time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get through as quickly as I can; that&#8217;s
why I&#8217;m not going to rush you unless it&#8217;s necessary,&#8221;
Lisle answered. &#8220;Try to get hold of the fact that a
man needs food regularly to keep him in efficient going
order.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indisputable,&#8221; Nasmyth agreed. &#8220;But he can
do without it and work for a while. We&#8217;ve proved
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not without paying,&#8221; Lisle pointed out. &#8220;You
can draw upon your reserves, but it takes time and rest
to make them good. We may need all ours badly before
we&#8217;re through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a grim hint in his last words which Nasmyth
found convincing, and when he had rested he
helped to prepare the meal. It was a simple one&mdash;cold
doughy cakes baked in a frying-pan, extraordinarily
tough and stringy venison, with a pint-can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
each of strong green tea. Their sugar had long ago
melted and the condensed milk was exhausted.
</p>
<p>Afterward, they shoved the canoe out and paddled
doggedly into the driving rain and the strong headwind.
The spray from the splashing bows blew into
their faces, and the broken water checked them badly.
Nasmyth&#8217;s hands began to blister. To make it worse,
there was a raw wound on one of them, the result of a
similar day&#8217;s toil; and his knees chafed sore against
the branches in the craft&#8217;s bottom. There was, however,
no respite&mdash;the moment they slackened their
exertions they would drift to lee&mdash;and he held on,
keeping awkward stroke with Jake, while Lisle swung
the balancing paddle astern.
</p>
<p>They kept it up for several hours, and then, toward
evening, the rain ceased and the clouds rolled aside.
A wonderful yellow light shone behind the bordering
hills, and the twisted, wind-battered cedars on their
crests stood out against it in hard, fretted tracery.
The wind dropped; the short, white waves smoothed
down; the water, heaving gently, gleamed with a coppery
glare, and the paddle blades seemed to splash up
liquid fire. Then the shores closed in ahead, and,
landing on a shingle beach, they made camp in the
mouth of a gap among the hills. Supper was prepared
and eaten, and afterward Jake took up his
rifle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw some ducks in the next bay,&#8221; he explained.
</p>
<p>He strolled out of camp, and Nasmyth smiled at
Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Except when he advised you to pole, that&#8217;s about
all he has said to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was correct. The packer was a taciturn inhabitant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
of the wilds who seldom indulged in an unnecessary
remark. There was, however, no moroseness
about him; the man was good-humored in his
quiet way, and his usual ruminative calm was no deterrent
from apparently tireless action. For the most
part, he lived alone in the impressive stillness of the
bush, where he had a few acres of partly cleared land
which failed to provide him with a living. For that
reason, he periodically left his tiny log house and
packed for some survey expedition, or went down to
work for a few months at a sawmill. Capable of most
determined labor, wonderfully proficient with his
hands, he asked no more from life than a little plain
food and indifferent shelter. No luxury that civilization
could offer would have tempted him to desert the
wilds.
</p>
<p>Lisle filled his pipe with leisurely content. He shared
Jake&#8217;s love for the wilderness, and he found it
strangely pleasant to rest in camp after a day&#8217;s persistent
toil. Besides, he usually enjoyed his evening
chat with Nasmyth, for, widely different as their training
and mode of life had been, they had much in common.
Then, too, there was something in the prospect
spread out before them that impelled tranquillity.
The clump of wet cedars among which they had
camped distilled a clean, aromatic smell; and there was
a freshness in the cool evening air that reinvigorated
their tired bodies. Above the low hilltops the sky
glimmered with saffron and transcendental green, and
half the lake shone in ethereal splendor; the other half
was dim and bordered with the sharply-cut shadows
of the trees. Except for the lap of water upon the
pebbles and the wild cry of a loon that rang like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
peal of unearthly laughter out of a darkening bay,
there was nothing to break the deep stillness of the
waste.
</p>
<p>Lisle pointed to the gap in the hills, which was filling
with thin white mist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the last big portage the Gladwynes made,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;They came in by a creek to the west,
and they were badly played out when they struck this
divide; the struggle to get through broke them up.&#8221;
He paused before he added: &#8220;What kind of men
were they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;George wasn&#8217;t effusive; he was the kind of man
you like better the longer you know him. If I were
told that he ever did a mean thing, I wouldn&#8217;t believe
it. His last action&mdash;sending the others on&mdash;was
characteristic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t want to go,&#8221; Lisle interposed quietly.
</p>
<p>His companion nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that&#8217;s true. I like to think so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was something curious in his tone, which Lisle
noticed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From the beginning,&#8221; Nasmyth went on,
&#8220;George behaved very generously to Clarence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Clarence that I meant to ask about more
particularly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked thoughtful, and when he answered,
it struck Lisle that he was making an effort to give an
unbiased opinion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clarence,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is more likable when you first
meet him than George used to be; a handsome man
who knows how to say the right thing. Makes friends
readily, but somehow he never keeps the best of them.
He&#8217;s one of the people who seem able to get whatever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
they want without having to struggle for it and who
rarely land in any difficulty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again a grudging note became apparent, as though
the speaker were trying to subdue faint suspicion or
disapproval, and Lisle changed the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had George Gladwyne any immediate relatives?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One sister, as like him as it&#8217;s possible for a woman
to be. He wasn&#8217;t greatly given to society; I don&#8217;t
think he&#8217;d ever have married. His death was a crushing
blow to the girl&mdash;they were wonderfully attached
to each other&mdash;but I&#8217;ve never seen a finer display of
courage than hers when Clarence cabled the news.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off, as if he felt that he had been talking
with too much freedom, and just then the report of
a rifle came ringing across the water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a duck&#8217;s head shot off. Jake doesn&#8217;t
miss,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Lisle nodded. He could take a hint; and he had no
doubt that Nasmyth was right regarding the shot,
though it is not easy to decapitate a swimming duck
with a rifle. He began to talk about the portage;
and soon after Jake returned with a single duck they
went to sleep.
</p>
<p>It was clear and bright the next morning and they
spent the day carrying their loads a few miles up
the hollow which pierced the height of the divide.
Part of it was a morass, fissured with little creeks
running down from the hills whose tops rose at no
great elevation above the opening. This was bad to
traverse, but it was worse when they came to a muskeg
where dwarf forest had once covered what was now
a swamp. Most of the trees had fallen as the soil,
from some change in the lake&#8217;s level, had grown too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
wet. They had partly rotted in the slough, and willows
had afterward grown up among them.
</p>
<p>Now and then the men laid down their loads and
hewed a few of the still standing trunks, letting them
fall to serve as rude bridges where the morass was
almost impassable, but the real struggle began when
they went back for the canoe. At first they managed
to carry her on their shoulders, wading in the
bog, but afterward she must be dragged through or
over innumerable tangles of small fallen trunks and
networks of rotten branches that had to be laboriously
smashed. It was heroic labor&mdash;sometimes they spent
an hour making sixty yards&mdash;and Lisle&#8217;s face grew
anxious as well as determined. Game had been very
scarce; the deer would not last them long; and disastrous
results might follow a continuance of their
present slow progress. When, utterly worn out, they
made camp on slightly firmer ground toward four
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, Lisle strode off heavily toward
the bordering hills, while Jake pushed on to
prospect ahead. Nasmyth, who was quite unable to
accompany either, prepared the supper and awaited
their reports with some anxiety.
</p>
<p>Lisle came back first and shook his head when Nasmyth
asked if he had found a better route on higher
ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a slope we could haul along,&#8221; he reported.
&#8220;That way&#8217;s impracticable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was nearly dark when Jake came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not too bad ahead,&#8221; he informed them.
</p>
<p>They were not greatly reassured, because Jake&#8217;s
idea of what was really bad was alarming. Nasmyth
glanced at his companion with a smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is it any better than this?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A little,&#8221; answered Jake. &#8220;An old trail runs
in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladwyne&#8217;s trail?&#8221; exclaimed Nasmyth. &#8220;The
one we&#8217;re looking for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; drawled Jake, as if it were scarcely
worth mentioning. &#8220;I guess it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth turned to Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was lucky when I lighted on you as a companion
for this trip. You have been right in your predictions
all along, and now you&#8217;re only out in striking
the trail a day before you expected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the bush,&#8221; returned Lisle. &#8220;It&#8217;s been
pretty easy so far&mdash;but, for several reasons, I wish
the next week or two were over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked troubled. One could have imagined
that misgivings which did not concern his personal
safety were creeping into his mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; he confessed, and turning toward the
fire he busied himself with Jake&#8217;s supper.
</p>
<p>There was no change in the work the next morning,
but in the afternoon it became evident that another
party had made that portage ahead of them. The
soil was a little drier and where the small trees grew
more thickly they could see that a passage had been
laboriously cleared. In the swampy hollows, which
still occurred, trunks had here and there been flung into
the ooze. This saved them some trouble and they made
better progress, but both Lisle and Nasmyth became
silent and grave as the signs of their predecessors&#8217;
march grew plainer. By nightfall they had reached
the second camping-place, which told an eloquent story
of struggle with fatigue and exhaustion. Lisle, stopping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
in the gathering dusk, glanced around the old
camp site.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good place to pitch the tent, but I think I&#8217;d
rather move on a little,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Nasmyth made a sign of comprehension.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sleep soundly here.
Everything about us is too plain a reminder; I&#8217;ve no
doubt you feel it as I do. A firm and trusted friend
lay, famishing, beside that fire, in what extremity of
weakness and suffering I dare not let myself think.
It&#8217;s possible he cut those branches yonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle&#8217;s face expressed emotion sternly held in check.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Vernon&#8217;s work&mdash;no Englishman new
to the country could have slashed them off so cleanly.
But look at this small spruce stump. He was the better
chopper, but it&#8217;s significant that he used three or
four strokes where I would have taken one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even the laconic Jake appeared relieved when they
forced their way a little farther through the tangled
undergrowth, until finding a clear space they set up the
tent.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE CACHE</h3>
</div>

<p>They spent the greater part of a week on the
portage, crossing here and there a little lake;
and then came out one evening on a river that
flowed, green and tranquil, beneath a ridge of hills.
Here they camped; and on rising with a shiver in the
raw and nipping dawn the next morning, Nasmyth
found Lisle busy at the fire. Jake was cutting wood
some distance off, for the thud of his ax rang sharply
through the stillness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was awake&mdash;thinking&mdash;a good deal last night;
in fact, I&#8217;ve been restless ever since we struck the
Gladwynes&#8217; trail,&#8221; Nasmyth began. &#8220;Now, I understand
that an uninterrupted journey of about sixteen
days would take us well on our way toward civilization.
You say you apprehend no difficulty after that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Lisle waited, watching his companion in an
intent fashion.
</p>
<p>Nasmyth hesitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, considering everything, mightn&#8217;t it be better
to waste no time, and push straight on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And leave the work that brought me here&mdash;I believe
that brought us both here&mdash;undone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll forgive me if I don&#8217;t express myself very
fortunately. What I feel is this&mdash;Gladwyne&#8217;s story
is a tragic one, but it&#8217;s twelve months old. In a way,
it&#8217;s forgotten; the wounds it made have healed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is such a man as the one you have described forgotten
in a year?&#8221; Lisle asked with a hardening expression.
</p>
<p>Nasmyth, being a man of simple and, for the most
part, wholesome ideas, was in a quandary. His feelings
were generous, but he shrank from putting them into
words. Moreover he was just and was not wholly convinced
that the course he wished to recommend was
right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he contended, &#8220;there are faithful hearts
that never quite forget&mdash;with them the scar remains;
but it&#8217;s fortunate that the first keen pain does not last.
Is it decent&mdash;I almost think that&#8217;s the right word&mdash;to
reopen the wound?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused and spread out one hand as if in expostulation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your late comrade has gone beyond your help; you
told me he had left no relatives; and you have only
yourself to consider. Can you do any good by bringing
this sorrowful tale of disaster up again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you pleading for your English friends, anxious
to save them pain at my expense? Can&#8217;t you
understand my longing to clear my dead partner&#8217;s
name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A trace of color crept into Nasmyth&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I deserve that, though it wasn&#8217;t quite
the only thing I meant. I&#8217;ve an idea that you are
somehow going to lay up trouble for yourself by persevering
in this search.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be offensive; but can&#8217;t you see that
by urging me to let the thing drop you are casting
grave doubts upon the honor of a man of your own
caste and kind, one with whom you are closely acquainted?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
Are you afraid to investigate, to look for
proofs of Clarence Gladwyne&#8217;s story?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked him steadily in the eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the sake of one or two others, I think I am.
Your belief in the guide, Vernon, has had its effect
on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Lisle, &#8220;I have no fear of putting my
belief to the test; I came up here for that purpose, and
I mean to call upon you as my witness. As you said
of George Gladwyne, the man I owe so much to never
did a shabby thing. That he should have deserted a
starving comrade is clean impossible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose there&#8217;s no help for it,&#8221; responded Nasmyth,
with a gesture of acquiescence. &#8220;We have said
enough. Since you insist, I&#8217;ll stand by my promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The thudding of the ax ceased, and they heard Jake
returning with the wood. Lisle set out the simple
breakfast, and when they had eaten they launched the
canoe and floated swiftly down the smooth green river
all that day. They had accomplished the worst half
of the journey; henceforward their way lay down-stream,
and with moderate good fortune they need
have no apprehension about safely reaching the settlements,
but they were both silent and ill at ease. Lisle
was consumed with fierce impatience; and Nasmyth
shrank from what might shortly be revealed to him.
Scarcely a word was spoken when they lay in camp
that night.
</p>
<p>The next day they came to the head of a long and
furiously-running rapid. Rocks encumbered its channel;
the stream boiled fiercely over sunken ledges, dropping
several feet here and there in angry falls; and
in one place, where the banks narrowed in, a white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
stretch of foaming waves ran straight down the middle.
Here they unloaded and spent the day laboriously
relaying their stores and camp-gear over the
boulders and ragged ledges between a wall of rock and
the water. It was a remarkably difficult traverse. In
places they had to hoist the leader up to some slippery
shelf he could not reach unassisted and to which
he dragged his companions up in turn; in others deep
pools barred their way, and in skirting them they
were forced to cling to any indifferent handhold on the
rock&#8217;s fissured side. As they toiled on, badly hampered
by their loads, the same thought was in the
minds of two of the men&mdash;a wonder as to how Gladwyne&#8217;s
exhausted party had crossed that portage, unless
the water had been lower. It was not difficult to
understand how the famishing leader had fallen and
lamed himself.
</p>
<p>When at last, toward the end of the afternoon, the
stores had been deposited on the banks of the pool
below, Lisle sat down and filled his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would take us most of two days to portage the
canoe, and we might damage her badly in doing so,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The head of the rapid&#8217;s impossible, but
with luck we might run her down the rest in about ten
minutes. The thing seems worth trying, though I
wouldn&#8217;t have risked it with the stores on board.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you swamped or upset her?&#8221; Nasmyth
suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s less likely, since she&#8217;d go light, with only two
of us paddling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth considered. The sight of the rapid was
not encouraging, but he shrank from the intense effort
that would be needed to transport the craft by the way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
they had come. Eventually it was decided to leave
Jake below, ready to swim out with the tracking-line
and seize the canoe if any mishap befell, and Lisle
and Nasmyth went back to the head of the rapid.
They dragged the canoe round the worst rush with
infinite difficulty; and then Nasmyth set his lips and
braced himself for the mad descent when his companion
thrust her off.
</p>
<p>A few strokes of the paddle drove them out into the
stream, and then their task consisted in holding her
straight and swinging her clear of the rocks that
showed up through the leaping foam, which was difficult
enough. Seen from the water, the prospect was
almost appalling, though it was blurred and momentarily
changing. Nasmyth&#8217;s eyes could hardly grasp
salient details&mdash;he had only a confused impression
of flying spray, rushing green water that piled itself
here and there in frothy ridges, flitting rocks, and
trees that came furiously speeding up toward him.
He had an idea that Lisle once or twice shouted sharp
instructions and that he clumsily obeyed, but he could
not have told exactly what he did. He only knew
that now and then he paddled desperately, but more
often he knelt still, gazing fascinated at the mad turmoil
in front of him.
</p>
<p>At last there was an urgent cry from Lisle and he
backed his paddle. The canoe swerved, a foaming
wave broke into her, and in another moment Nasmyth
was in the water. He was dragged down by the
swirling stream, and when he rose he dimly saw the
canoe a few yards in front of him. He failed to
reach her&mdash;she was traveling faster than he was&mdash;and,
though he could swim well, he grew horribly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
afraid. It struck him that there was a strong probability
of his being driven against a boulder with force
enough to break his bones or of being drawn down
and battered against the stony bottom. Still, he
struck out for a line of leaping froth between him
and the bank and was nearing it when Lisle grasped
his shoulder and thrust him straight down-stream.
Scarcely able to see amid the turmoil, confused and
bewildered, he nevertheless realized that it was not
desirable to attempt a landing where he had intended.
Yielding to the guiding impulse, he floundered down-stream,
until Lisle again seized him and drove him
shoreward, and a few moments later he stood up,
breathless, in a few feet of slacker water. He waded
to the bank, and then turned to Lisle, who was close
behind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;I owe you something for
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; disclaimed the other. &#8220;I only pulled
you back. You&#8217;d have got badly hammered if you&#8217;d
tried to cross that ledge. I&#8217;d noticed the inshore swirl
close below it when we were packing along the bank,
and remembered that we could land in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you had hold of the canoe. I saw you close
beside her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wanted her to take me past the ledge,&#8221; Lisle
explained. &#8220;I&#8217;d no notion of going right through
with her. Now we&#8217;ll make for camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On arriving there as darkness closed down, they
found that Jake had recovered the craft. The paddles
had gone, but he could make another pair in an
hour or two. They had a few dry things to put on,
and as they lay beside the fire after supper they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
were sensible that the slight constraint both had felt
for the last two days had vanished. Neither would
have alluded to the feeling which had replaced it,
nor, indeed, could have clearly expressed his thoughts,
but mutual liking, respect and confidence had suddenly
changed to something stronger. During the few minutes
they spent in the water a bond, indefinite, indescribable,
but not to be broken, had been forged between
the two.
</p>
<p>The next morning it was clear and cold, and they
made good progress until they landed late in the afternoon.
Then, after scrambling some distance over
loose gravel, Lisle and Nasmyth stopped beside a
slight hollow in a wall of rock. A few large stones
had been rudely placed on one another to form a shelter;
there were still some small spruce branches, which
had evidently been used for a roof, scattered about;
and the remains of a torn and moldering blanket lay
near by. In another place was a holed frying-pan
and a battered kettle.
</p>
<p>Nasmyth gravely took off his shapeless hat, and
stood glancing about him with a fixed expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;is where my friend died&mdash;as
you have heard, they afterward took his body
out. There are few men who could compare with
that one; I can&#8217;t forget him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done, and little that could
be said; and they turned away from the scene of the
tragedy, where a man, who to the last had thought
first of his companions, had met his lonely end.
Launching the canoe, they sped on down-river, making
a few easier portages, and four days later they
landed on the bank of a turbulent reach shut in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
by steep, stony slopes. There was a little brushwood
here and there, but not a tree of any kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was on this beach that Gladwyne made one
cache,&#8221; said Lisle. &#8220;If there had been a cypress or
a cedar near, he&#8217;d have blazed a mark on it. As it
is, we&#8217;d better look for a heap of stones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They searched for some time without finding anything,
for straight beach and straight river presented
no prominent feature which any one making a cache
would fix upon as guide. Lisle directed Nasmyth&#8217;s
attention to this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was deep snow when Vernon came down the
gorge, on this side,&#8221; he pointed out. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t
follow that he was with the others when they
buried the stores&mdash;he might have been carrying up
a load&mdash;and it&#8217;s possible they couldn&#8217;t give him a
very exact description. If I&#8217;m right in this, he&#8217;d
have a long stretch of beach to search, and a man&#8217;s
senses aren&#8217;t as keen as usual when he&#8217;s badly played
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth made no comment, but his expression suggested
that he would not be disappointed if they failed
to strike the cache. Shortly afterward, however, Jake
called out, and on joining him they saw a cross
scratched on a slab of slightly projecting rock. Even
with that to guide them, it was some time before they
came upon a few stones roughly piled together and
almost hidden in a bank of shingle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, I want you to notice that this gravel
has slipped down from the bluff after the cache was
made,&#8221; Lisle said to Nasmyth. &#8220;With snow on the
ground and the slab yonder covered, it would be almost
impossible to locate it.&#8221; He turned to Jake. &#8220;How
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
long would you say it was since the rain or frost
brought that small stuff down?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake glanced at the young brushwood growing
higher up the slope. It was shorter than that surrounding
it, and evidently covered the spot which the
mass of débris had laid bare in its descent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of one summer and all the next,&#8221; he answered
decidedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us how you figured it out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake climbed the bank and returned with two or
three young branches which he handed to Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing&#8217;s plain enough to you.&#8221; He turned
toward Nasmyth. &#8220;No growth except in the summer&mdash;they&#8217;d
had a few warm months to start them,
but they don&#8217;t fork until the second year. See these
shoots?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As winter was beginning when the Gladwyne party
came down, that small landslide must have taken place
some time before then,&#8221; declared Lisle.
</p>
<p>They set to work and carefully moved aside the
stones. First they uncovered three cans of preserved
meat, and then a small flour bag which had rotted
and now disclosed a hard and moldy mass inside.
There was also another bag which had evidently contained
sugar; and a few other things. All examined
them in silence, and then sat down grave in face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate that nobody could positively state
whether this cache has been opened or not since it was
made, but there are a few points to guide us,&#8221; said
Lisle. &#8220;Do you know what kind of food civilized
men who&#8217;ve been compelled to work to exhaustion on
insufficient rations, helped out by a little fish or game,
generally long for most?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nasmyth, with a feeble attempt at
levity. &#8220;I&#8217;ve now and then remembered with regret
the kind of dinner I used to get in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have scarcely felt the pinch,&#8221; Lisle informed
him. &#8220;The two things are farinaceous stuff
and sugar. No doubt, it will occur to you that Vernon
might have taken a can or two of meat; but that&#8217;s
not likely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re right about the longing for flour and
sweet-stuff, it&#8217;s a strong point,&#8221; Nasmyth declared.
&#8220;Where did you learn the fact?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle looked at Jake, and the packer smiled in a
significant manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right,&#8221; he vouched. &#8220;We know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; continued Lisle, indicating the sugar bag,
which had been wrapped in a waterproof sheet, &#8220;can
you imagine a starving man, in desperate haste, making
up this package as it was when we found it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Nasmyth; &#8220;it&#8217;s most improbable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somewhat to his astonishment, the usually taciturn
Jake broke in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wasting time! Vernon never struck this
cache&mdash;he told the folks at the post so. Worked
with him once trail-cutting&mdash;what that man said
goes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never told me you knew Vernon!&#8221; exclaimed
Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite likely,&#8221; Jake drawled. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t seem
any use till now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For the first time since they landed, Nasmyth
laughed&mdash;he felt that something was needed to relieve
the tension.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If people never talked unless they had something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
useful to say, there would be a marvelous change,&#8221; he
declared.
</p>
<p>Lisle disregarded this, but he was a little less grave
when he resumed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another point to bear in mind. Two of
Gladwyne&#8217;s party left him; and of those two which
would be the more likely to succumb to extreme exertion,
exposure, and insufficient food?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Against the answer you expect, there&#8217;s the fact
that Vernon made the longer journey,&#8221; Nasmyth objected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t count for much. Was Clarence Gladwyne
accustomed to roughing it and going without
his dinner? Would you expect him to survive where
you would perish, even if you had a little more to
bear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; confessed Nasmyth; &#8220;he&#8217;s rather a self-indulgent
person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, for example, could you march through a
rough, snow-covered country on as little food as I
could?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, again,&#8221; answered Nasmyth. &#8220;You would
probably hold out two or three days longer than I
could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vernon was a stronger and tougher man than I
am,&#8221; Lisle went on. &#8220;Now, without finding definite
proof, which I hardly expected, there is, I think,
strong presumptive evidence that Vernon&#8217;s story is
correct.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Nasmyth, and added gravely:
&#8220;Will you ever find the proof?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a way&mdash;it may be difficult; but
I&#8217;m going right through with this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your next move?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve willingly laid my partner&#8217;s story open to the
only tests we can impose. Now I&#8217;m going to do the
same with Clarence Gladwyne&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nothing more was said, and turning away from the
cache, they went back to the canoe.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A PAINFUL DECISION</h3>
</div>

<p>Two days passed uneventfully, though Nasmyth
was conscious of a growing uneasiness during
them; and then one evening they landed to
search another beach. They had less difficulty here,
for small cedars and birches crept down to the waterside
and Jake found an ax-blaze on one. After that,
it was easy to locate the cache, and there were signs
that it had been either very roughly made, or afterward
opened and reclosed in careless haste. Lisle
had no hesitation in deciding upon the latter, and
Jake was emphatic in his brief assurance on the point.
</p>
<p>On removing the covering stones, they found very
little beneath them, but every object was taken out
and Lisle, measuring quantities and guessing weights,
carefully enumerated each in his notebook. Neither
he nor Nasmyth said anything of import then; both
felt that the subject was too grave to be lightly discussed;
and walking back silently along the shingle,
they pitched the tent and prepared supper. After the
meal, Jake, prompted by an innate tact, sauntered
away down the beach, and the other two, lounging beside
the fire, took out their pipes. A full moon hung
above the lonely gorge, which was filled with the roar
of the river, and the shadows of the cedars lay black
upon the stones.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>Some minutes passed before a word was spoken;
and then Nasmyth looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he said briefly.
</p>
<p>Lisle moved a little, so that he could see his companion&#8217;s
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;Clarence Gladwyne
came down this bank. One could locate the
cache by the blazed tree, even with snow upon
the ground&mdash;and it has been opened. Apart from the
signs of this, no party of three men would have
thought it worth while to make a cache of the few
things we found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mightn&#8217;t it have been opened by some Indian?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s most unlikely, because he would have cleaned
it out. A white prospector would certainly have taken
the tobacco.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth knit his brows. He was deeply troubled,
because there were respects in which the matter would
hardly bear discussion, though he recognized that it
must now be thrashed out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he admitted reluctantly, &#8220;what we have
discovered has its significance; but it isn&#8217;t conclusive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His companion took out from a pocket the palm
and wrist portion of a fur glove. It was badly rotted,
and the rest had either fallen away or been gnawed
by some animal, but a button with a stamp on it remained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake found that and gave it to me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s enough left to show that it had finger-stalls,
and there are none on the mittens we use in cold
weather. The thing&#8217;s English, and with a little rubbing
I expect you&#8217;ll find the maker&#8217;s name on that button.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
When the party went up it was warm weather,
but we know there was sharp frost when Gladwyne
came back. A buttoned glove doesn&#8217;t drop off one&#8217;s
hand, and even if it had done so Gladwyne would have
noticed and picked it up. It seems to me he took it
off to open one of the provision bags and couldn&#8217;t
find it afterward because he&#8217;d trodden it into the
snow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth could doubt no longer, and his face grew
red.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The hound!&#8221; he broke out. &#8220;He had a hand
frost-bitten&mdash;one finger is different from the others
yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle said nothing; he could understand and sympathize
with what was going on in his companion&#8217;s
mind and the latter was filled with bitterness and
humiliation. A man of his own kind and station in
life, one with whom he fished and shot, had broken
faith with his starving comrade and with incredible
cowardice had left him to perish. Even this was not
the worst; though Nasmyth had always taken the personal
courage of his friends for granted. He was
not a clever man and he had his faults, but he shaped
his life in accordance with a few simple but inflexible
rules. It was difficult for him to understand how
one could yield to a fit of craven fear; but there was
a fact which made Gladwyne&#8217;s transgression still
blacker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This thing hits hard,&#8221; he said at length. &#8220;The
man should have gone back, if he had known it meant
certain death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle filled his pipe and smoked in silence for several
minutes during which the eery cry of a loon rang
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
about the camp. It roused Nasmyth to an outbreak
of anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate that unearthly noise!&#8221; he exclaimed vehemently.
&#8220;The thing seems to be gloating; it&#8217;s indecent!
When I think of that call it will bring back
the long portage and this ghostly river! I wish I&#8217;d
never made the journey, or that I could blot the whole
thing out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be done,&#8221; Lisle replied. &#8220;It&#8217;s too late.
You have learned the truth of what has been done
here&mdash;but the results will work themselves out.
Neither you nor I can stop them; they have to be
faced.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The pity of it is that the innocent must suffer;
they&#8217;ve borne enough already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a point I don&#8217;t quite understand,&#8221; declared
Lisle. &#8220;Whatever the Hudson Bay agent
thought, he&#8217;d have kept it to himself if he&#8217;d been allowed&mdash;I&#8217;ve
met him. It was Gladwyne who laid the
whole blame on Vernon; he forced the agent to bear
him out. Why should he have taken so much trouble?
His own tale would have cleared him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked irresolute; and then he answered
reluctantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a fact I haven&#8217;t told you yet&mdash;Clarence
came into the family property on George&#8217;s death;
a fine old place, a fairly large estate. The sister
doesn&#8217;t count, though she got her brother&#8217;s personal
property&mdash;the land goes down in the male line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle dropped his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I understand! Gladwyne profits, my dead
partner bore the shame. But do you believe the man
meant to let his cousin die?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Nasmyth answered sharply, &#8220;that&#8217;s unthinkable!
But I blame him almost as much as if he
had done so. Besides his duty to George, he had a
duty to himself and to the family&mdash;the honorable
men and women who had kept the name clean before
him. Knowing he would inherit on George&#8217;s death,
there was only one way open&mdash;he should have gone
back, at any cost. Instead, to clear himself of the
faintest trace of ugly suspicion, he lays the blame
upon an innocent man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle did not reply to this. He felt that had the
grim choice been imposed upon his companion, the
man would have taken the course he had indicated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said that George Gladwyne was a naturalist,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;Was he a methodical man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eminently so,&#8221; replied Nasmyth, wondering where
the question led. He had already been astonished at
Lisle&#8217;s close reasoning and the correctness of his deductions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he would have made notes on his journey
and no doubt have kept some kind of diary. Did the
rescue party recover it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They did. It was given to George&#8217;s sister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damaged by snow or water, badly tattered?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; assented Nasmyth. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had the book
in my hands. I suppose it&#8217;s natural that you should
guess its condition, but I don&#8217;t see what it points to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle smiled grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One wouldn&#8217;t be astonished to find some leaves
missing from a tattered book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right again.&#8221; Nasmyth started. &#8220;Several
had gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can tell which part of the journey they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
related to. A methodical man would make a note of
the stores cached, and the lists would be conclusive
evidence if anybody afterward opened the caches and
enumerated their contents, as we have done. If
everything put into the one on the bank Vernon followed
remained there, it would prove that he couldn&#8217;t
have found it. On the other hand, if the one on
Gladwyne&#8217;s side of the river&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; Nasmyth broke in. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
labor the point; it&#8217;s plain enough.&#8221; He stopped for
a few moments before he went on again. &#8220;I&#8217;m convinced;
but without that list of Gladwyne&#8217;s you still
haven&#8217;t proof enough to place your account of the
affair beyond dispute. What are you going to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to England&mdash;it&#8217;s my father&#8217;s country,
and I meant to visit it some day. Whether I shall find
out anything more there or not I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must stay with me. That&#8217;s a point I
insist upon. But I must make my situation clear&mdash;though
I&#8217;ve been drawn into this matter against my
will, you have my promise, and if ever the time for
action comes, I&#8217;ll stand by you. But I&#8217;ll take no part
in trapping Clarence Gladwyne into any admission,
nor will I countenance any charge against him unless
some chance supplies you with indisputable evidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Lisle; &#8220;I&#8217;m agreeable. You stand
neutral until I call on you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two more questions, and then we&#8217;ll let
the subject drop. Why didn&#8217;t you make this search
earlier? Why didn&#8217;t Gladwyne rearrange the caches
afterward? He went back, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re easily answered. It was some time before
I heard of Vernon&#8217;s death and met the Hudson Bay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
man in Victoria&mdash;I&#8217;d been away in the North. Gladwyne
had the rescue party with him when he went back;
he couldn&#8217;t replace the provisions in the cache on this
side without their knowing it, and I don&#8217;t suppose he
could have crossed the river to the other cache. Now
we&#8217;ll talk of something else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They started again the next morning, and instead
of leaving the river for the Hudson Bay post, which
stood farther back into the wilderness, they held on
down-stream, though they afterward regretted this
when their provisions once more grew scanty. There
was now sharp frost at nights; fangs of ice stretched
out behind the boulders and crackling sheets of it
gathered in the slacker eddies along the bank. What
mattered more was that the portages were frequent,
and carrying the canoe over rock coated with frozen
spray became dangerous as well as difficult, and Nasmyth
working on short rations began to feel the
strain. It was only since he had entered that inhospitable
region that he had ever been compelled to go
without his dinner; and now breakfast and supper
were sternly curtailed. When they were stopped for
two days by a blinding snowstorm he grew anxious,
and his uneasiness had increased when some time afterward
they made their evening meal of a single flapjack
each. He could readily have eaten a dozen of
the thin, flat cakes. The duck they had shot every
now and then since crossing the divide had gone; they
had not seen a trout since the cold set in; and there
did not appear to be any salmon in the river.
</p>
<p>After breakfast the next morning, Lisle concluded
that it would be wise to risk a day looking for a deer,
so he invited Nasmyth to take his rifle and the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
set out. It cost them some trouble to climb the low
bluff above the river through a horrible tangle of
fallen trunks. The trees were getting larger and the
branches of those the wind had brought down lay
spread about them or were resting on the standing
growth in networks which Nasmyth would have
thought it impossible to traverse had he been alone.
Lisle scrambled through, however, and he had no
choice except to follow. Where the timber was thinner,
the slope was covered with sharp-edged stones
which further damaged his already dilapidated boots;
and when at last they came out upon a comparatively
bare, rocky tableland, a bitter wind met them in the
teeth. It drove a little fine snow before it, but Lisle
plodded steadily on, explaining that any deer which
might be in the neighborhood would have gone down
into the sheltered valleys. He had no doubt they
would find one of the valleys, for they were generally
numerous.
</p>
<p>It was an hour before they reached one, and Nasmyth
was conscious of an unpleasant pain in his side
and a headache which he supposed resulted from want
of food. For all that, he scrambled after his companion
down an almost impossible descent, where
trees of increasing size grew up among outcropping
rock and banks of stones. When he reached the bottom
he found himself in a deep rift filled with densely-matted
underbrush, through which a swift stream
flowed. Its banks promised a slightly easier road,
though now and then they had to wade through the
water, which was icy cold. Noon came and they had
seen no sign of life, except two or three willow-grouse
which they failed to dislodge from cover; but Lisle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
held on, his course running roughly in a line with the
river.
</p>
<p>It was toward three o&#8217;clock, and a little snow was
sifting down between the somber branches overhead,
when Lisle, stopping, raised a warning hand and
pointed to an opening in the trees. The light was
dim among the rows of trunks, and for a few seconds
Nasmyth gazed down the long colonnade, seeing
nothing. Then Lisle pointed again, impatiently, and
he made out something between a gray trunk and a
thicket. Sportsman as he was, he had not the bush-man&#8217;s
eye, and he would never have supposed that
formless object to be a deer. It moved, however; a
prong of horn appeared; and waiting for nothing
further he pitched up his rifle.
</p>
<p>It was a long shot, standing; he guessed the range
in a deceptive light; but he found himself strangely
steady as he squeezed the trigger. He was desperately
hungry and weak from want of food; the deer
must not escape. Yet he was in no rash haste; for
two or three seconds the tiny foresight trembled
slightly upon the mark, while the pressure on the
trigger increased. Then there was a flash; he heard
no report but the smoke blew into his eyes. Almost
simultaneously, a train of red sparks leaped out from
somewhere close at his side and there was a sharp
snapping in the bush ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You got your shot in!&#8221; cried Lisle. &#8220;I think I
missed him on the jump. Come on; we must pick up
the trail!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was easy to find; the deer had been too badly
hit to bound across each obstacle as cleanly as usual,
and broken twigs and scattering withered leaves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
showed which way it had gone. Besides, there were
red splashes here and there. It was, however, a difficult
matter to follow the trail. Fallen trees and
dense thickets barred the way, and they had to cross
the creek every now and then. Nasmyth rapidly got
breathless and before long he was badly distressed,
but he held on behind his companion. Once or twice he
was held fast for a moment or two, and breaking free,
found he had badly ripped his garments on the ragged
branches. Still, it was unthinkable that they should
let the deer escape.
</p>
<p>As he struggled forward, he remembered that the
days were rapidly shortening, and he shrank from the
prospect of retracing his way to camp in the dark.
It occurred to him that it was a compliment and a
mark of very fine courtesy that Lisle had left the
first shot to him. In return for this, he must endeavor
to be present to assist when he was wanted.
</p>
<p>The deer was still invisible, but it was not very far
ahead, for at times the snapping of a stick or a rustle
of disturbed underbrush came sharply out of the
woods. The light was getting dimmer and the snow
was falling more thickly.
</p>
<p>At last the hunted creature left the valley and after
a desperate scramble the men reached the summit of
the ridge above. Here the tableland between them
and the river was covered with straggling bush, and
though the undergrowth was thin they could see
nothing but the long rows of shadowy trunks. Lisle,
however, picked up the trail, and they followed it as
rapidly as possible until, when Nasmyth was lagging
some distance behind, there was a shout in front of
him and his companion&#8217;s rifle flashed. Making a last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
effort, he broke into a run and presently came to the
brink of a steep descent covered with thick brush and
scattered trees, with a wide reach of palely gleaming
water at the foot of it. It was the kind of place
one would have preferred to climb down cautiously,
but there was a sharp snapping and crackling below
and Nasmyth knew that a hard-pressed deer will
frequently take to the water. If it crossed the
river, it would escape; and that could not be contemplated.
</p>
<p>Holding his rifle up, he plunged madly down the
descent, smashing through matted bushes, stumbling
over slippery stones. Once or twice he collided with
a slender tree and struck his leg against some ridge
of rock; but he held on, gasping, and the water
rapidly grew nearer. He had almost reached it when
a dim shape broke out from a thicket at the bottom
of the slope. There were still some cartridges in his
rifle cylinder, but he was slipping and sliding down
an almost precipitous declivity at such a rate that it
was impossible to stop and shoot. Indeed, in another
moment he fell violently into a brake and had some
difficulty in smashing through it, but when he
struggled free he saw shingle and boulders in front of
him and Lisle bounding across them a few yards behind
the deer. He reached the stones, wondering why
Lisle did not fire; and then he saw man and deer
plunge into the water together.
</p>
<p>A few seconds later he was waist-deep in the swift
icy current, savagely endeavoring to drag the animal
toward the bank, while Lisle stood near him, breathing
hard, with a red hunting-knife in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady!&#8221; gasped Lisle. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do it that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
way! Help me throw the beast on his side. Now
heave!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They got the deer out, and Nasmyth sat down
limply. All the power seemed to have gone out of
him; he did not want to move, though he was filled
with exultation, for they now had food. It was a
minute or two before he noticed that Lisle had left
him; and then he saw him coming back with his rifle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dropped the thing,&#8221; Lisle explained. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
snap a fresh shell in; guess I bent the slide. I took
the knife to finish it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In another moment or two you&#8217;d have been too
late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It wouldn&#8217;t have been decided until
we&#8217;d reached the other side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would have swum across?&#8221; Nasmyth asked
in astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Lisle simply. &#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;d have
tried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced at the river. It was broad, icy
cold, and running fast, and he could hardly imagine
a worn-out and half-fed man safely swimming it.
Lisle, however, called upon him to assist in an unpleasant
operation which, when Nasmyth had killed a
deer at home, had been judiciously left to the keepers
or gillies. After that, he was directed to light a fire
on a neighboring point, from which it could be seen
some way up the river, and by and by Jake arrived
in the canoe. Then they made camp, and after a
feast on flesh so tough that only hungry men could
have eaten more than a few morsels of it they went to
sleep.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>MILLICENT GLADWYNE</h3>
</div>

<p>In a few more days they left the river, abandoning
the canoe and tent and a portion of their gear.
Ascending to higher levels, they crossed a rugged
waste, which, fortunately for them, was thinly timbered;
but there was keen frost, and snow in places,
and Nasmyth suffered a good deal during this portion
of the journey. At last, however, they descended to
a sheltered valley in which the firs grew tall, and Jake
agreed with Lisle that it would form the best road
to the settlements.
</p>
<p>Nasmyth was longing for civilization when he lay
awake late one night, wrapped in a single blanket,
beside the sinking fire. Dark columnar trunks rose
about him, touched with the uncertain red radiance
now and then cast upon them when little puffs of bitter
wind stirred the blaze, and he could see the filmy
wreaths of smoke eddy among the branches. He was
cold and overtired; the day&#8217;s march had been a long
one; his shoulders ached cruelly after carrying a
heavy load, and every joint was sore. Besides, his
bed was unpleasantly hard, and he envied his companions,
who had long ago sunk into heavy slumber.
For the last hour he had been thinking over the discoveries
he had made on the journey, which he devoutly
wished he had never undertaken; the thought
of them had troubled him on other bitter nights.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
Lisle was not the man to let the matter drop; he was
much more likely to follow it up with dogged persistence
to the end; and Nasmyth, who was to some
extent pledged to assist him, saw trouble ahead.
</p>
<p>In spite of this, he was beginning to get drowsy
when a faint and yet strangely melodious chiming
broke through the whispering of the firs. It seemed
to come from above him, falling through the air, and
he roused himself to listen, wondering if he were quite
awake. The musical clash he had first heard had
ceased, but for a while he thought he could distinguish
the tolling of a single bell; then in varying
notes the peal broke out again.
</p>
<p>There was something ethereal in the clear tones.
The last time he had heard anything like them he was
sitting one Sunday morning on a shady lawn while
the call of the bells came softly up to him across the
English woods. He glanced at his comrades, but
they showed no sign of hearing, and raising himself
on one elbow he lay and listened, until the music,
growing fainter and fainter, died away. Then, puzzled
and half convinced that his imagination had
played him some fantastic trick, he went to sleep.
</p>
<p>He mentioned the occurrence diffidently at breakfast
the next morning, expecting incredulous laughter;
but Lisle, without making a comment, glanced at
Jake questioningly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; responded Jake. &#8220;Nothing to bring them
up so far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have been mistaken?&#8221; Lisle asked
Nasmyth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I must be; but the more I listened, the
clearer it got.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go and see,&#8221; Lisle said, addressing Jake, and when
they had finished breakfast the packer strode away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait a bit,&#8221; advised Lisle. &#8220;I&#8217;m a little
worried about provisions again. It&#8217;s still a long
march to the nearest wagon trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth failed to understand how the delay would
improve their position, but believing that his companion
was somewhat dubious about his tale he restrained
his curiosity. In half an hour Jake came
back and nodded to Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a bunch of them,&#8221; he reported. &#8220;I struck
the fellow&#8217;s trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it I heard?&#8221; Nasmyth asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cow-bells,&#8221; Lisle explained, laughing. &#8220;In this
country, they generally put them on any cattle that
run loose in the timber. Some adventurous rancher
has located up here, though I hadn&#8217;t expected to find
one so far north. Anyway, it&#8217;s a relief; he&#8217;ll no
doubt be able to let us have something to eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They reached the man&#8217;s log house an hour later,
and spent the day with him, enjoying a much needed
rest. The next morning he supplied them with provisions
and told them how to find a trail down to a
wagon road; and, setting out, they safely reached
a settlement in regular communication with the cities.
</p>
<p>It was the settlement Lisle had expected to come
to, and he found a bundle of correspondence awaiting
him there. Before he opened it, however, he and
Nasmyth supplied themselves with such clothing as
they could obtain at the local store, and then demanded
a bath at the little wooden hotel. They had some
trouble in obtaining it, but Nasmyth was firm, and
eventually he sat down to supper, clad in a blue shirt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
with scarlet trimmings, extremely tight-fitting clothes
and daintily-pointed shoes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d have done better if I&#8217;d stuck to my
rags, or else bought a pair of what that fellow called
river-Jacks&#8217; boots,&#8221; he commented ruefully.
</p>
<p>Lisle was similarly attired, but he was too busy with
his meal to sympathize with him, and some time after
it was over Nasmyth, strolling into the private room
which they had obtained as a signal concession, found
him writing at a littered table. Sitting down, he
watched him for a while with some slight wonder.
For a number of weeks, he had seen his companion
handling heavy loads, cooking, and hauling canoes
round rapids with the skill of a professional packer.
It was hard to disassociate him from the ranges and
the bush; but now, with the pile of letters before him,
he had suddenly become a business man. Nasmyth
saw him answer a couple in a swift, decided manner
which showed that he was at home in his present occupation.
It was one of the quick character-changes
which, while common in the West, are apt to bewilder
the more stereotyped Englishman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you coming to England with me?&#8221; Nasmyth
asked at length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t,&#8221; answered Lisle, pausing,
pen in hand. &#8220;This Gladwyne matter will probably
take time and I have none to spare now. There have
been some unexpected developments in my affairs. I
don&#8217;t know when I can get away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth was conscious of some relief. His companion
would have to defer the prosecution of plans
that threatened to cause trouble in England, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
was something to be thankful for, though he had a
strong sympathy for the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has it ever struck you that you might have less
difficulty if you could be content with proving half of
what you claim?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s the more important
part&mdash;I mean that your late comrade failed to find
the cache.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Half a truth is not much use&mdash;Gladwyne realized
that. To declare you haven&#8217;t done the wrong is a
good deal less effective than pointing to the guilty
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s correct,&#8221; Nasmyth agreed.
&#8220;But, after all, unless you can get hold of a list of
the provisions cached&mdash;and it has most likely been
destroyed&mdash;there&#8217;s only one way of substantiating
your views.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Gladwyne&#8217;s confession will place the
matter beyond all doubt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you will ever get it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle&#8217;s expression hardened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth abandoned all attempt to daunt or dissuade
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;when you come over you
must stay with me. I&#8217;m sorry we&#8217;ll have to part company
to-morrow. I start east by the first train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He strolled out into the moonlight and the keen
frosty air. The little wooden town was soon left
behind, and sauntering down the rough wagon road
beneath towering firs, he saw the great hill summits
glitter white against the sky. It was a wonderful
country; the grandest he had ever traversed; but it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
demanded a good deal from the man who ventured
into its wilds, and he was not sorry that he was turning
his back on it.
</p>
<p>Then, as he thought of the land he was bound for
and recalled the tragic story of Gladwyne&#8217;s journey,
he once more grew troubled. He realized the immutable
sequence of cause and effect&mdash;each action had
its result which must be faced however much one repented
and regretted it. The deed, once done, could
not be altered and, what was worse, its consequences
reached out to others. Then he wondered whether
Clarence had ever repented, and admitted, with a recurrence
of his indignation against the man, that it
was far from probable. Clarence was one who took
life lightly, and although his means had been small
until he came into his cousin&#8217;s possessions, he had somehow
succeeded in getting what is often considered the
best out of it. Self-denial in any shape was unknown
to him.
</p>
<p>The next morning Nasmyth took the train for Montreal,
and about a fortnight later alighted at a little
station in the north of England as the early dusk
was closing in. It was a quiet evening and the soft
moistness of his native air struck him as something
pleasantly familiar after the keener, drier atmosphere
of the Dominion. He was glad to be back again, but
when he looked around, the trap waiting in the wet
road outside the railings was not his own. Neither
did it belong to Clarence, whom he had partly expected;
but on the whole Nasmyth was glad of that.
He had not looked forward to the first meeting with
Clarence with any pleasure.
</p>
<p>In another moment, a girl came along the platform
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
through the groups of local passengers, who respectfully
made way for her. She was tall, and her long
outer garment failed to conceal her grace of movement
and fine poise, though in the fading light her
face was almost invisible beneath a large hat. The
sight of her sent a thrill of satisfaction through the
man; it was seldom that Millicent Gladwyne&#8217;s appearance
was unwelcome to her friends. She approached
him with outstretched hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I drove over for you. Clarence couldn&#8217;t come;
he was suddenly called up to town,&#8221; she began. &#8220;It
would have been rather lonely for you to spend the
first evening by yourself at the Lodge. You will
come to us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thoughtful as ever,&#8221; smiled Nasmyth, with a little
bow which was respectful as well as friendly. &#8220;I
needn&#8217;t ask how you are; the way you walked along the
platform was a testimony to our Border air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed, softly and musically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is more needful to inquire how you have stood
your adventures?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;m thinner; but that isn&#8217;t astonishing,
everything considered. I suppose Clarence is getting
on pretty satisfactorily?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clarence? Oh, yes!&#8221; There was a hint of uncertainty
in her voice which Nasmyth noticed. &#8220;He
has been in town a good deal of late. But come
along; the horse&mdash;he&#8217;s a new one&mdash;is rather restive.
They&#8217;ll send on your things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The remnant of my outfit&#8217;s contained in one small
bag,&#8221; laughed Nasmyth; &#8220;the rest&#8217;s scattered about
the hillsides of British Columbia. I was a picturesque
scarecrow when I reached the settlements.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>They moved away along the platform, and on
reaching the trap he got up beside her and handed her
the reins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to look about, if you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; he explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really think the prospect&#8217;s worth it,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;Besides, Riever&#8217;s fresh and needs humoring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She shook the whip, and as they clattered away down
the steep, twisting road, Nasmyth glanced with satisfaction
to left and right. He had seen wilder and
grander lands, but none of them appealed to him like
this high, English waste. On one hand dim black
hills rose out of fleecy mist; on the other a leafless
birch wood, close by, stood out in curiously fragile and
delicate tracery against a paling saffron glow, though
overhead the sky was barred with motionless gray
cloud. A sharp smell of peat-smoke followed them as
they clattered past a low white cottage with a yellow
glow in one window; and then the earthy scent of rotting
leaves replaced it as they plunged into the gloom
of an oak wood beneath the birches. A stream splashing
down a hollow made faint music in the midst of it.
When they had emerged from the shadow and climbed
a steep rise, wide moors stretched away in front, rising
and falling in long undulations, streaked with belts of
mist. The crying of restless plovers came out of the
gathering dimness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All this is remarkably nice; though I don&#8217;t think
I should have appreciated it quite so much if I&#8217;d been
alone,&#8221; Nasmyth said at length.
</p>
<p>Millicent laughed lightly. She had known him since
her childhood and was quite aware that he had not intended
to pay her a labored compliment; they were too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
good friends for that. Once, indeed, he had desired
a closer bond, but he had quietly acquiesced when with
gentle firmness she had made it clear that she was not
for him. Submission had not been easy, but he had
long admitted her right to more than he could offer.
In this, however, he was to some extent mistaken, because
the gifts he could bring&mdash;a staunch honesty,
faithfulness, and a genial nature&mdash;are not to be despised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I love these moors and dales,
as of course you know, and I&#8217;ve become more of a stay-at-home
than ever during the past year.&#8221; There was
a slight regretfulness in her voice which had its meaning
for him. &#8220;I&#8217;m never satisfied with the drawings,&#8221;
she went on, &#8220;though I&#8217;ve made so many of
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth made a sign of comprehension. She had
undertaken to finish and illustrate her brother&#8217;s
roughed-out work, a book on the fauna of the Border,
and she had brought to it a fine artistic skill and
patience, as well as a love of the wild creatures of the
waste. It was, perhaps, a curious occupation for a
young woman, but she had devoted herself to it with
characteristic thoroughness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wanted it to be as complete and accurate as
possible,&#8221; she added simply.
</p>
<p>Her companion felt compassionate. In some respects,
it was almost a pity that Millicent could not
forget.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You got my letter&mdash;the one in which I said
I meant to pick up and follow out his trail?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I knew it would be difficult. Indeed, I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
anxious about you; the wilderness has claimed so much
from me. But did you&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I succeeded,&#8221; Nasmyth answered quietly.
</p>
<p>The nod she gave him was expressive. It meant
that she had expected him to succeed; he was a man
who did what he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think George should never have made that journey,&#8221;
she resumed. &#8220;Fond of the open as he was,
he hadn&#8217;t the physical stamina. He never spared himself;
he was apt to overestimate his powers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was spoken with a grave regretfulness that troubled
Nasmyth and yet stirred him to strong appreciation
of her character. With all her love for her
brother, she could face the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned that he bore everything with the fortitude
one would expect from him&mdash;doing his share
always with the rest,&#8221; Nasmyth said. &#8220;We got
through a little earlier, and had better weather; but I
saw enough to convince me that the difficulties George
had to contend with would have killed any ordinary
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They did not kill Clarence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth once more burned with anger against the
transgressor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied in a strained tone; &#8220;Clarence escaped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She flashed a sharp glance at him, and he felt glad
that it was too dark for her to see his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must tell me the whole story to-night,&#8221; she
requested.
</p>
<p>Her companion made no answer. With the reserve
that must be maintained on several points, the story
would be difficult to relate; and it could not fail to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
painful to her. The horror she would feel if she ever
learned that her brother might have been saved had his
cousin shown more resolution was a thing he dare not
contemplate, and he wondered if the shock the knowledge
must bring could be spared her. This depended
upon Lisle, whom he had promised to assist. Nasmyth
could foresee nothing but trouble, and he was
silent for a while as they drove on across the lonely
moor.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>NASMYTH TELLS HIS STORY</h3>
</div>

<p>Dinner was over, and Millicent&#8217;s elderly companion
had discreetly left them alone, when the
girl led Nasmyth into her drawing-room. It
was brightly lighted and was tastefully decorated in
delicate colors, and a wood fire was burning on the
hearth; but, for the first time that he could remember,
Nasmyth felt ill at ease in it. He was fresh from the
snow-covered rocks and shadowy woods and the refinement
and artistic luxury of his surroundings rather
jarred on him. The story he had to relate dealt with
elemental things&mdash;hunger, toil, and death&mdash;it would
sound harsher and more ugly amid the evidences of
civilization.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a good deal to tell me,&#8221; Millicent suggested
at length.
</p>
<p>He stood still a moment, looking at her. She had
already seated herself, and the sweeping lines of her
pose suggested vigor and energy held in quiet control.
Her face was warm in coloring, bearing signs
of exposure to wind and sun, but it was chastely molded
in a fine oval with the features firmly lined. Her hair
was dark, though there were bronzy gleams in it, and
her eyes, which were deeply brown, had a sparkle in
them. As a whole, her appearance indicated a sanguine,
optimistic temperament, but there was also an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
indefinite something which spoke of due balance and
repose. Nasmyth was more convinced than ever that
he had not met any other woman fit to compare with
her. Her age, as he knew, having given her many
birthday presents, was twenty-four.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, in answer to her remark, &#8220;but it&#8217;s
curious that I can&#8217;t fix my mind upon the subject here.
The night&#8217;s mild; shall we go out on to the veranda?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until I get a wrap. I understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You always do that,&#8221; Nasmyth declared.
</p>
<p>She joined him outside in another minute and seated
herself in the chair he drew out. The house was small
and irregularly built, and a glass roof supported on
light pillars stretched along part of the front. A
half-moon hung above a ridge of dark fir wood, a tarn
gleamed below, and here and there down a shadowy hollow
there was a sparkle of running water. On the
other side of the dale the moors stretched away, waste
and empty, toward the half-seen hills. The loneliness
of the prospect reminded Nasmyth of Canada,
and the resemblance grew more marked when the crying
of plover rose from the dim heath&mdash;it brought
back the call of the loon. Still, he did not wonder
why Millicent, an orphan with ample means, lived alone
except for her elderly companion on the desolate Border.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind, I know,&#8221; he said as he lighted a
cigar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make that concession willingly,&#8221; she answered
with a smile. &#8220;I suppose I&#8217;m old-fashioned,
because I go no farther.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep so,&#8221; advised Nasmyth. &#8220;Of course, that&#8217;s
unnecessary; but I never could make out why women
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
should want to smoke. From my point of view, it
isn&#8217;t becoming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was putting off a task from which he shrank, and
she indulged him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One retains one&#8217;s prejudices in a place like this,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I felt sadly left behind when I was last in
London; and the few visits I made in the home counties
a little while ago astonished me. Nobody seemed
to stay at home; the motors were continually whirling
them up to town and back; the guests kept coming
and going. There was so much restlessness and bustle
that I was glad to be home again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has struck me,&#8221; returned Nasmyth with an air
of sage reflection, &#8220;that we who live quietly in the
country are the pick of the lot. Sounds egotistical,
doesn&#8217;t it? But if we don&#8217;t do much good&mdash;and I&#8217;m
afraid I don&#8217;t, anyway&mdash;neither do we do any harm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that that&#8217;s a great deal to be proud
of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t include you,&#8221; Nasmyth assured her.
&#8220;There have been wholesome changes in the village
since you grew up and made your influence felt. And
that leads to a question: How does Clarence get on
with his tenants and the rank and file? George understood
them, but they&#8217;re difficult folks to handle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s away a good deal&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid there has
been some friction now and then.&#8221; The girl&#8217;s manner
suddenly changed. &#8220;But that&#8217;s beside the point.
Aren&#8217;t you wasting time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am almost afraid to begin. You will find the
story trying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned toward him, and the moonlight showed
her face was reassuringly quiet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I expect that; but your fears are groundless. You
needn&#8217;t hesitate on my account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth knew that she was right; Millicent was not
one to flinch from pain. With an effort, he began his
story at the portage over the divide, and, possessed by
vivid memories, he made her see the desolate region
they had laboriously traversed. Because her imagination
was powerful, she could picture the brother she
had loved toiling with desperate purpose and failing
strength through muskeg and morass. Then, when
she quietly insisted, he described Gladwyne&#8217;s last camp.
She saw that, too: the hollow beneath the dark rock,
with the straggling cedars on the ridge above. Next
he outlined the journey down the first few rapids, saying
little about the caches, and at last, with considerable
relief, he came to a stop. Millicent sat silent
for several minutes, during which he did not look at
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said at length. &#8220;I have tried
often to imagine it, and failed; but it is quite clear
now. Clarence would never give me more than the
barest details&mdash;I think he hated to speak of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, he was wise,&#8221; replied Nasmyth. He
understood the man&#8217;s reluctance. &#8220;Now don&#8217;t you
think it would be better if you tried to drive the thing
out of your mind? It can&#8217;t be altered&mdash;there&#8217;s a
danger in dwelling too much upon one&#8217;s grief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked up at him, though her eyes were dim with
tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be driven out. There were only the two
of us; we had so much in common&mdash;there was such
trust between us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded in comprehension and sympathy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now that I&#8217;ve told you,&#8221; he said quietly, as he
rose, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go. I am sure you&#8217;d rather be
alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, motioning to him to sit down.
&#8220;Please stay.&#8221; She seemed to rouse herself with an
effort. &#8220;Of course, there was only one thing George
could do when he was lamed&mdash;send them on. But
Clarence, who was with him, never made his fortitude
and cheerfulness so clear as you have done. You even
mentioned the exact words he said now and then&mdash;how
did you hear of them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From my companion, a young Canadian. He had
the whole thing by heart; got it from the Hudson Bay
agent. George&#8217;s guide told the agent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did your companion also teach you how to tell the
story?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled. He saw that she was desirous of
changing the subject and he was glad of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, he made me see it at the time; pointed
out the full significance of things&mdash;a broken branch,
a scratch on a rock. A rather striking man in several
ways. But you shall see him; he&#8217;s coming over to
stay with me by and by.&#8221; He paused a moment. &#8220;I
understand that Clarence has been having some trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It hardly amounts to that. But things are not the
same as they were&#8221;&mdash;in spite of her courage she
faltered&mdash;&#8220;when George held control. The tenants
don&#8217;t take to Clarence; I think he was not well advised
in increasing rents here and there. Indeed, that was a
little puzzling, because he was once so liberal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In small matters; it&#8217;s his own money now.&#8221;
Nasmyth could not repress this show of bitterness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whose money was it in his extravagant days?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a question I&#8217;ve thought over and failed to
find an answer to. I&#8217;ve no doubt most of what he
gets is now being spent in town, though in my opinion
as much as possible ought to go back to the locality
in which it was produced. Why don&#8217;t you impress
that on him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent, as he knew, could judiciously offer sound
advice where it was needed. She was young, but, having
been left an orphan early, she had long enjoyed
her brother&#8217;s close companionship and confidence, and
the man&#8217;s wide knowledge and thoughtfulness had had
its effect in molding her character. Still, in this case,
she did not respond.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be better for his tenants and the neighborhood
generally if Clarence married; he can afford
it now,&#8221; Nasmyth went on.
</p>
<p>Again the girl was silent, and he wondered whether
he had thoughtlessly made a serious blunder. It had
been supposed among their friends that she would
marry Clarence some day, though, so far as it was
known, there was no definite understanding between
them, and for a while the man&#8217;s attitude had strengthened
the idea. Indeed, when he had succeeded to
George&#8217;s possessions, every one had expected an announcement,
which had not been made. What Millicent
thought, or what she had looked for all along, did not
appear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are right in one thing,&#8221; she said, very
calmly, at length. &#8220;If he would stay here, as George
did and his neighbors do, it would be better for everybody,
including himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth made a sign of agreement. Their intimate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
friends remained for the greater portion of the
year on their estates, understanding the needs of their
tenants and dependents and enjoying their good opinion,
which was naturally increased by the fact that
their expenses were chiefly incurred in the neighborhood.
There were others who, as the small farmer
recognized, returned as little as possible to the soil,
squandering revenues raised by the stubborn labor of
others in doubtful pleasures elsewhere and, when they
brought their friends home, on luxuries despatched
from town. These things made for bitterness.
</p>
<p>An unfortunate persistence in his hobby drove Nasmyth
into a second blunder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in accord on that point,&#8221; he assured her.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity the land passed out of your hands. However,
as there&#8217;s no male succession, it might, after all,
come back to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She bore it very calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have me speculate on such a thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then as if to find a safer topic she went on with a
thrill of anger in her tone:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you of an incident I witnessed two or three
days ago, which annoyed me seriously. I&#8217;d just met
old Bell&mdash;you know how lame he is&mdash;driving some
sheep along the road. It has been a wet, cold year;
Bell lost his hay, the oats are dreadfully poor, and his
buildings are in very bad repair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were a disgrace to any estate when I last
saw them,&#8221; Nasmyth broke in. &#8220;Besides, the sour
land near the river should have been tile-drained long
ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So Bell has urged; but he can&#8217;t get Marple to
spend a penny&mdash;I&#8217;m glad that man&#8217;s new to this part
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
of the country and doesn&#8217;t belong to us. Well, just
after I met Bell, Marple&#8217;s big motor came along. He
had Batley with him and the Crestwicks, who were
down before. I think you met them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; assented Nasmyth. &#8220;In Canada they&#8217;d
call them a mighty tough crowd; they&#8217;re about the
limit here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I turned round after the car had passed,&#8221; Millicent
went on. &#8220;Marple was driving, as fast as
usual, and he made no attempt to pull up. Bell, who
didn&#8217;t hear, tried to jump and fell into the ditch; most
of the sheep were scattered across the moor, but two
or three got right in front of the car and at the last
moment Marple had to stop. One of the women
laughed, she had a very shrill voice and she explained
that the old man looked so funny in the ditch; Marple
shouted to Bell&mdash;something about the damage to his
tires&mdash;and I could see the others smiling at what he
said. That was worse than the words he used. Then
they went on, leaving the old man to gather up his
sheep; he hadn&#8217;t a dog with him. That kind of thing
leaves its mark!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Distinctly so,&#8221; Nasmyth agreed. &#8220;Still, Marple
and his lot are exceptions. Wasn&#8217;t Clarence rather
thick with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been rather disturbed
about him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth did not know what this meant. He
thought she would hardly have made such an admission
had she contemplated marrying the man; and, if
not, it was somewhat difficult to see why he should
cause her serious concern. He knew, however, that
Millicent could not look on unmoved when her friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
left the right path; he could think of two or three
whom she had helped and gently checked from further
straying. This reflection was a relief to him, because
he was determined that she should not marry Clarence
if he could prevent it. If necessary, he would tell her
the part the man had played in Canada, though he
shrank from doing so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marple and his acquaintances are not the people
one would have expected Clarence to associate with,&#8221;
he continued. &#8220;Still, in my opinion, he&#8217;s doing worse
in making a friend of that fellow Batley. I could
never understand the connection&mdash;the man strikes me
as an adventurer. Has he spent much time here since
I&#8217;ve been away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good deal, off and on. But it&#8217;s getting chilly
and I half expect a reproving lecture from Miss Hume
when I go in. First, though, tell me a little more
about the young Canadian you had with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much. I met him by accident&mdash;he
has an interest in some mines, I believe, but he struck
me as a remarkably fine type. Clever at woodcraft, as
handy with the ax and paddle as our professional
guide, but when he talked about other things he seemed
to know a good deal more than I do.&#8221; He smiled.
&#8220;After all, that&#8217;s not surprising. But what I liked
most was the earnestness of the fellow; he had a downright
way of grappling with things, or explaining
them to you. Sensible, but direct, not subtle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met men of that description, and I&#8217;m rather
prejudiced in their favor,&#8221; declared Millicent, smiling.
&#8220;But what was he like in person&mdash;slightly rugged?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s where you and others sometimes go
wrong. There&#8217;s nothing of the barbarian about these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
bushmen. Physically, they&#8217;re as fine a type as we are&mdash;I
might go farther&mdash;straight in the limb, clean-lined
every way, square in the shoulder. They&#8217;d make
an impression at any London gathering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as they didn&#8217;t speak?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t matter. Allowing for a few colloquialisms,
they&#8217;re worth listening to; which is more
than I&#8217;d care to say for a number of the people one
meets in this country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be glad to see him when he comes.&#8221; Her
voice grew graver. &#8220;I feel grateful to him already
for what he told you about George.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went in together and half an hour later Nasmyth
walked home across the moor. He had never
thought more highly of Millicent, but somehow he now
felt sorry for her. It scarcely seemed fitting that she
should live in that lonely spot with only the company
of an elderly and staid companion, though he hardly
thought she would be happier if she plunged into a
round of purposeless amusements in the cities. Still,
she was young and very attractive; he felt that she
should have more than the thinly-peopled countryside
had to offer.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>ON THE MOORS</h3>
</div>

<p>Nearly a year had passed since Nasmyth&#8217;s return
when Lisle at length reached England.
Soon after his arrival, he was, as Nasmyth&#8217;s
guest, invited to join a shooting party, and one bright
afternoon he stood behind a bank of sods high on a
grouse-moor overlooking the wastes of the Border.
The heath was stained with the bell-heather&#8217;s regal
purple, interspersed with the vivid red of the more
fragile ling, and where the uplands sloped away broad
blotches of the same rich colors checkered the grass.
In the foreground a river gleamed athwart the picture,
and overhead there stretched an arch of cloudless blue.
There was no wind; the day was still and hot.
</p>
<p>A young lad whose sunburned face already bore the
stamp of self-indulgence was stationed behind the
butt with Lisle, and the latter was not favorably impressed
with his appearance or conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out,&#8221; he cautioned by and by. &#8220;You
were a little slow last time. They travel pretty fast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle picked up his gun; he had used one in the
West, though he was more accustomed to the rifle.
Cutting clear against the dazzling sky, a straggling
line of dark specks was moving toward him, and a
series of sharp cracks broke out from the farther wing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
of the row of butts, which stretched across the moor.
Lisle watched the birds, with fingers tightening on his
gun; one cluster was coming his way, each flitting
body growing in size and distinctness with marvelous
rapidity. Then there was a flash beside him, and another
crash as he pitched up his gun. Something
struck the heather with a thud not far away, and
swinging the muzzle a little, he pulled again. He
was not surprised to hear a second thud, and laying
down his gun he turned to his youthful companion,
while a thin cloud of acrid vapor hung about him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get anything?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; was the sullen answer. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t expect
it with the second barrel, after you&#8217;d filled the
place with smoke. Wonder why Gladwyne&#8217;s man gave
you the old black powder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As nearly everybody else used smokeless, this was
a point that had aroused Lisle&#8217;s curiosity, though it
was not a matter of much importance. Nasmyth had
provided him with cartridges, but they had somehow
been left behind, and on applying to Gladwyne&#8217;s
keeper he had been supplied with ammunition which,
it seemed, was out of date.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, you have done well enough,&#8221; his companion
resumed. &#8220;We&#8217;d better get on to our next
station&mdash;it&#8217;s right across the moor on the high ridge
yonder. Don&#8217;t bother about the birds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I leave them there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly! Do you want to carry them all the
afternoon? One of the keeper fellows will bring them
along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad&#8217;s tone was half contemptuous; he had already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
shown that he considered the Canadian what he
would have called an outsider; but he was willing to
make use of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might look after Bella; she&#8217;s alone in the
next butt&mdash;and I&#8217;ve something else to do,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s an awkward ghyll to cross and she won&#8217;t
carry anything lighter than a 14-gun. See she doesn&#8217;t
leave the cartridges in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He strode away across the heather, and Lisle turned
toward the turf shelter indicated. As he approached
it, a girl appeared and glanced at him with very
obvious curiosity; but as he supposed that she was the
sister of his late companion he did not expect any
diffidence from her. She was short in stature and
slight in figure, and dressed in grayish brown; hat,
coat, and remarkably short skirt all of the same material.
Her hair was of a copper color; her eyes,
which were rather narrow, of a pale grayish-green.
He would have called them hard, and there was a hint
of arrogance in her expression. Yet she was piquantly
pretty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re Nasmyth&#8217;s Canadian friend?&#8221;
she began, and went on without waiting for an answer:
&#8220;As we occupy adjoining butts on the next
drive, you may take my gun. Teddy has deserted
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Teddy?&#8221; queried Lisle, who wondered if she were
referring to her brother. &#8220;I thought his name was
Jim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Marple&#8217;s stout friend with the dyed hair I
mean. I told him what would happen if he ate as he
persisted in doing at lunch. It&#8217;s too hot to gormandize;
I wasn&#8217;t astonished when he collapsed at the steep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
place on the last walk. Reflecting that it was his own
fault, I left him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle was not charmed with the girl&#8217;s manners, but
he could not check a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you tired? You oughtn&#8217;t to be,&#8221; she continued
with another bold glance at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;if it&#8217;s any consolation to you,
I&#8217;m far from exhausted yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s reassuring,&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t
taken my gun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Having forgotten it for the moment, he flushed a
little, and she watched him with unconcealed amusement
while he opened the weapon and took out the
cartridges.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that for?&#8221; she asked impertinently. &#8220;It&#8217;s
hammerless; there&#8217;s nothing to catch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The pull-off&#8217;s probably very light, if it&#8217;s been
made for a lady&#8217;s use. It&#8217;s sometimes possible to jar
the strikers down when they set the springs to yield at
a touch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know something about guns?&#8221; she said,
as if she had not expected this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a great deal about the scatter kind, though
I&#8217;ve stripped a few.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We never do that,&#8221; she informed him. &#8220;We send
them to London. Still, you&#8217;re right; the gun did go
off when I knocked it jumping down from a wall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll let me have it to-night, I&#8217;ll alter that.
I understand we&#8217;re going out again to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She considered a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she consented, with the air of one conferring
a favor, &#8220;you may take it when we&#8217;ve finished.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>Lisle wondered what had prompted him to make the
offer. The way she had addressed him was not ingratiating,
but he delighted in examining any fine
mechanism and he had never handled such a beautifully
made weapon.
</p>
<p>They plodded on side by side through the heather,
which was long and matted, and presently, seeing that
she was breathless, he stopped on the crest of a higher
rise and once more looked about with keen appreciation.
</p>
<p>In front of him the crimson and purple heath was
rent and fissured, and in the deep gaps washed out by
heavy rains the peat gleamed a warm chocolate-brown.
Elsewhere, patches of moss shone with an emerald
brightness, and there were outcrops of rock tinted
lustrous gray and silver with lichens. Below, near
the foot of the moor, ran a straight dark line of firs,
the one coldly-somber streak in the scene; but beyond
it the rolling, sunlit plain ran back, fading through
ever varying and softening colors to the hazy blue
heights of Scotland.
</p>
<p>Lisle&#8217;s companion noticed his intent expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rather fine up here,&#8221; she conceded. &#8220;I sometimes
feel it&#8217;s almost a pity one couldn&#8217;t live among
the heather. Certain things would be easier on these
high levels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; interrogated Lisle, slightly puzzled and
astonished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re obviously from the woods,&#8221; she smiled.
&#8220;If you had spent a few years among my friends, you
would understand. I was referring to the cultivation
of ideas and manners which seem to be considered out
of date now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>Lisle made no reply to this, but he glanced too directly
at a red stain on her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I had a bet with Alan
that I&#8217;d get a brace more than Flo; that&#8217;s why I went
after a cripple running in the ling. It wasn&#8217;t dead
when I picked it up&mdash;rather horrid, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man was conscious of some disgust. She
looked very young and, slight as she was, her figure
was prettily rounded and she had a soft, kittenish
gracefulness; but she spoke with the assurance of a
dowager. Though he had killed and cut up many a
deer, he shrank from the small red stain on her delicate
hand. She saw it and laughed, and then with a sudden
change of mood she stooped and swiftly rubbed
her fingers in the heather.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said sharply, &#8220;if you&#8217;re sufficiently
rested, we&#8217;ll go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle moved away, but he asked a question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do many girls shoot in this country?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered with a mocking smile; &#8220;not so
many, after all. That&#8217;s comforting, isn&#8217;t it? This
kind of thing is hard work, and damaging to the complexion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Presently they came to a wall, and Lisle stopped in
some uncertainty. It was as high as his shoulders and
built of loose, rough stones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get over,&#8221; she ordered him. &#8220;Then pull a lot of
it down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did so, making, though he endeavored to avoid
this, a rather wide hole.
</p>
<p>She scrambled through agilely and then regarded
him with surprise as he proceeded to replace the
stones.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you doing that?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are sheep up here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many, considering that it&#8217;s a grouse-moor;
but what of it? They don&#8217;t belong to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They belong to somebody who would rather they
didn&#8217;t stray,&#8221; Lisle rejoined. &#8220;In the country I come
from, it&#8217;s considered a serious transgression to knock
over another person&#8217;s fence and not put it up
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He calmly went on with his task, and sitting down
she took out a silver cigarette-case. After a minute
or two she looked up at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re doing that very neatly,&#8221; she remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done something of the kind for a living,&#8221;
Lisle informed her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! It&#8217;s curious that you seem proud of it. In
this case, I don&#8217;t mind your keeping me, because they
can&#8217;t drive up the birds until we have crossed the
higher moor. It will annoy Gladwyne and his keeper,
and I&#8217;m not pleased with either of them. I wanted
Flo Marple&#8217;s station at the first butts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle considered this. He had wondered why she
had favored him with her company, when, although
her previous companion had deserted her, she could
by hurrying a little have joined the others. The butts
were not spaced very far apart. Their late occupants
had, however, now vanished into a dip of the moor.
He asked himself why a girl with her assurance should
have troubled to offer him an explanation.
</p>
<p>When he had finished the repairs to the wall, they
went on, and a little later he heard a sharp &#8220;Cruck&mdash;cruck-curruck,&#8221;
to one side of him. Swinging
around, he saw a grouse skimming the heather.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A pair of gloves to a sovereign that you miss!&#8221;
cried his companion.
</p>
<p>The bird was flying fast; Lisle had to load, and by
the time he had snapped in a cartridge it was a long
range. This, however, was somewhat in his favor, as
he was better used to the rifle. There was a flash and
the bird struck the heath. The girl glanced at him
in unveiled appreciation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A clean kill!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;You have won
the gloves; and you&#8217;ll deserve them before you have
heard the last of this incident. I suppose you don&#8217;t
know that you shouldn&#8217;t have fired a shot except from
behind the butts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She watched his expression with open amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like to ask why I tempted you,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;It was to vex the keeper; you may have
turned back the birds the beaters are driving up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for the information,&#8221; Lisle said coolly.
&#8220;Do you mind my inquiring whether you would have
taken the sovereign in case I&#8217;d missed? As you suggested,
I&#8217;m lately from the wilds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; she mocked. &#8220;I could have had it
drilled and worn it on a chain!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man made no comment as they went on. Presently
they came to a deep rift in the moor through
which a stream leaped sparkling. The girl scrambled
down, waist-deep in yellow fern, but the other side was
steep and stony and she was glad of help when he held
out his hand. They made the ascent with some difficulty
and on reaching the summit she looked around,
breathless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a romantic spot, if you&#8217;re interested in the
legends of the Border,&#8221; she told him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; Lisle said; and she sat down among the
heather.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an excuse for a rest,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;The
old moss-troopers used to ride this way to ravage Cumberland.
It was advisable for them to follow hidden
paths among the moors, and once an interesting little
skirmish took place among those brakes down the hollow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She pointed toward a spot where the ravine widened
into a level strip of quaggy grass and moss which
glowed a brilliant emerald. On either side of it a
gnarled and stunted growth of alders and birches
fringed the foot of the steep slopes, and between them
the stream spread out across a stretch of milk-white
stones. The hollow was flooded with light and filled
with the soft murmur of running water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a strong place to hold, if the defenders
had time to choose their ground,&#8221; Lisle remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it proved,&#8221; replied his companion. &#8220;Well,
once upon a time, a bold Scots reaver, riding south,
saw a maid who pleased him near a Cumberland pele.
His admiration was not reciprocated, but he came
again, often, though being an armed thief by profession
there was a price upon his head. It is stated
that on each occasion he returned unaccompanied by
any of the cattle belonging to his lady&#8217;s relatives,
which was an unusual piece of forbearance. In those
days, men must have been able to disassociate business
from their love-making.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they do so now?&#8221; Lisle inquired lazily.
</p>
<p>She looked at him with a smile which had a hint of
real bitterness in its light mockery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not often, one would imagine. Perhaps they can&#8217;t
be blamed&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re all given to cultivating
dreadfully expensive tastes. No doubt, when it was
needful, the Border chieftain of the story could live
on oatmeal and water, and instead of buying pedigree
hunters he probably stole his pony. He haunted the
neighborhood of the pele until the maid became afraid
and urged her kinsmen to rid her of him. Several of
them tried and failed&mdash;which wasn&#8217;t surprising.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Love made him invulnerable?&#8221; Lisle suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; retorted his companion. &#8220;A man with a
heart constant and stout enough to face the risks he
ran would be hard to kill. When you read between
the lines, it&#8217;s a moving tale. Think of the long, perilous
rides he made through an enemy&#8217;s land, all for a
glance at his disdainful lady! They watched the fords
in those days, but neither brawling rivers nor well-mounted
horsemen could stop him. At last, he came
one night with a dozen spears, broke in the barmkin
gate and carried her off. All her relatives rode hard
after them and came up with them in this ghyll.
Then there happened what was, in one way, a rather
remarkable thing&mdash;the abducted maid firmly declined
to be rescued. There was a brisk encounter,
I believe two or three were killed; but she rode off to
Scotland with her lover. I suppose I needn&#8217;t point
the moral?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see only the ancient one&mdash;that it&#8217;s unwise
to take a lady&#8217;s &#8216;No&#8217; as conclusive,&#8221; Lisle ventured.
</p>
<p>She laughed at him in a daring manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The pity is that we haven&#8217;t often a chance of saying
it to any one worth while. But I&#8217;ll express the
moral in a prettier way&mdash;sometimes disinterested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
steadfastness and real devotion count with us. Unfortunately,
they&#8217;re scarce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a challenge in her glance, but the man,
not knowing what was expected of him, made no answer.
At first he had been almost repelled by the
girl, but he was becoming mildly interested in her.
She could, he thought, be daring to the verge of coarseness,
and he did not admire her pessimism, which was
probably a pose; but there was a vein of elfish mischief
in her that appealed to him. Sitting among the
heather, small, lithe, and felinely graceful, watching
him with a provocative smile in her rather narrow eyes,
she compelled his attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;you&#8217;re not much of a courtier.
But doesn&#8217;t that story bring you back into touch
with elemental things&mdash;treacherous mosses, dark
nights, flooded rivers, passion, peril, dauntlessness?
Now we&#8217;re wrapped about with empty futilities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He understood part of what was in her mind and
sympathized with it. He had lived close to nature in
stern grapple with her unbridled forces. From women
he demanded no more than beauty or gentleness; but
a man, he thought, should for a time, at least, be
forced to learn the stress and joy of the tense struggle
with cold and hunger, heat and thirst, on long
marches or in some dogged attack on rock and flood.
He had only contempt for the well-fed idlers who
lounged through life, not always, as he suspected, even
gracefully. These, however, were ideas he had no intention
of expressing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are still people who have to face realities in
the newer lands; and I dare say you have some in this
country, on your railroads and in your mines, for example,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
he said. &#8220;But hadn&#8217;t we better be getting
on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They left the brink of the hollow and plodded
through the heather toward where a row of butts
stood beneath a lofty ridge of the moor. A man appeared
from behind one as they approached and
glanced at them with unconcealed disapproval.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you have got here earlier, Bella?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;In another few minutes you&#8217;d have spoiled
the drive&mdash;the birds can&#8217;t be far off the dip of the
ridge. Hardly fair to the keepers or the rest of us
to take these risks, is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I do wrong, I never confess it, Clarence,&#8221;
the girl replied. &#8220;You ought to know that by
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle heard the name and became suddenly intent&mdash;this
was Clarence Gladwyne! There was no doubt
that he was a handsome man. He was tall and held
himself finely; he had a light, springy figure, with
dark eyes and hair. Besides, there was a certain stamp
of refinement or fastidiousness upon him which was
only slightly spoiled by the veiled hint of languid
insolence in his expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard a shot,&#8221; he resumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt you did,&#8221; the girl agreed. &#8220;An
old cock grouse got up in front of us&mdash;it was irresistibly
tempting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne turned to Lisle with a slight movement of
his shoulders which was somehow expressive of half-indulgent
contempt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Nasmyth&#8217;s friend from Canada? I guess
you don&#8217;t understand these things, but you might have
made the birds break back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;However, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
must get under cover now&mdash;there&#8217;s your butt. I&#8217;ll
see you later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned away and Lisle took up his station behind
the wall of turf pointed to. He had once upon a time
been forcibly rebuked for his clumsiness at some unaccustomed
task in the Canadian bush and had not resented
it, but the faint movement of Gladwyne&#8217;s shoulders
had brought a warmth to his face. The girl
noticed this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clarence can be unpleasant when he likes, but
there are excuses for him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A day&#8217;s shooting
is one of the things we take seriously, and manners
are not at a higher premium here than I suppose they
are in the wilds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle made no response, and there was silence on the
sun-steeped moor until a row of small dark objects
skimming the crest of the ridge above became silhouetted
against the sky. Then a gun cracked away to the
right and in another moment a dropping fusillade
broke out.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>GLADWYNE RECEIVES A SHOCK</h3>
</div>

<p>It was about nine o&#8217;clock in the evening, and Gladwyne&#8217;s
somewhat noisy guests were scattered
about his house and the terrace in front of it.
Several of them had gathered in the hall, and Bella
Crestwick, Lisle&#8217;s companion on the moors, stood, cigarette
in hand, with one foot on the old-fashioned
hearth-irons, frankly discussing him. A few birch
logs glowed behind the bars, for on those high uplands
the autumn nights were chilly, but the wide door stood
open, revealing a pale green band of light behind the
black hills, and allowing the sweet, cool air of the
moors to flow in.
</p>
<p>The girl had gained something by the change from
her outdoor attire to the clinging evening dress, but
it was with characteristic unconcern that she disregarded
the fact that the thin skirt fell well away from
one shapely ankle effectively displayed by a stocking
of the finest texture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is a bit of a Puritan. They
still live over there, don&#8217;t they? His idea of English
women is evidently derived from what his father told
him, or from early-Victorian literature. I&#8217;m inclined
to believe I shocked him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s highly probable,&#8221; laughed a man lounging
near. &#8220;Still, I believe the descendants of the folks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
you mention live three thousand miles from his country,
in the neighborhood of the Atlantic shore. One
wouldn&#8217;t fancy that you&#8217;d like Puritans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was nothing offensive in the words, but his
glance was a little too bold and too familiar, and Bella
looked at him with a gleam of malice in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Extremes meet; it&#8217;s the middle&mdash;the medium mediocrity&mdash;that&#8217;s
irreconcilable with either end,&#8221; she
retorted. &#8220;For instance, I led a life of severe asceticism
all last Lent.&#8221; There were incredulous smiles,
though the statement was perfectly correct. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
course I could confidently recommend to you,&#8221; she proceeded,
unheeding; &#8220;of late you have been putting on
flesh with an alarming rapidity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man made no response and Bella resumed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, the Puritans have their good points;
they&#8217;re so refreshingly sure of themselves and their
views, while the rest of us don&#8217;t believe in anything.
You can&#8217;t be a fanatic without being thorough, and
in renouncing the world and the flesh you may gain
more than a passable figure. Among other things,
the ascetic life means straight shooting, steady hands,
and an eye you can depend upon. The overcivilized
man who does nothing to counterbalance his luxuriousness
is generally a rotter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what has all this to do with Nasmyth&#8217;s Canadian?&#8221;
somebody asked.
</p>
<p>Bella waved her cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to walk a steep moor with him and you&#8217;ll see.
If that&#8217;s not sufficient, take the same butt with him
when the grouse are coming over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly she straightened herself, dropping her foot
from the iron and flinging the cigarette into the fire,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
as a gray-haired lady entered the hall. She had been
a beauty years ago and now her fragility emphasized
the fineness of her features and the clear pallor of her
skin. She was dressed in a thin black fabric, and her
beautifully shaped hands gleamed unusually white
against its somber folds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Clarence?&#8221; she asked the group collectively,
in a voice that was singularly clear and penetrative.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him for the last half-hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the men immediately went in search of him,
and the lady crossed the hall to where Millicent Gladwyne
was sitting, for the time being alone. Millicent
had noticed Bella&#8217;s sudden change of demeanor upon
her hostess&#8217;s entrance, with something between amusement
and faint disgust. Mrs. Gladwyne was what
Bella would have called early-Victorian in her views,
and she would occasionally have been disturbed by the
conversation of some of her son&#8217;s guests, had she not
been a little deaf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sitting quiet?&#8221; she said to Millicent, who was a
favorite of hers; and her voice carried farther than
she was aware of as she continued: &#8220;I heard the
laughter and it brought me down, though I want to
tell Clarence something. I like to see bright faces;
but the times have changed since I was young. We
were a little more reserved and not so noisy then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A dear old thing! It&#8217;s a pity she&#8217;s quite so antediluvian,&#8221;
Bella remarked to a man at her side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the natural penalty of being a dear old
thing?&#8221; laughed her companion. &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt
we have progressed pretty rapidly of late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clarence appeared shortly after this and was gently
chidden by his mother for going out without his hat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
because the autumn nights were getting chilly. A
few minutes later, footsteps became audible outside the
open door and Nasmyth entered the hall with Lisle.
It was spacious and indifferently lighted; the others,
standing near the hostess, concealed her, and Lisle
stopped for a word with Bella. Then Nasmyth noticed
Mrs. Gladwyne and called to his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This way, Vernon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clarence swung round with a start and cast a swift
glance at the stranger, and Millicent wondered why
his face set hard; but the next moment Nasmyth led
up the Canadian and presented him. Mrs. Gladwyne
had risen and Lisle made a little respectful inclination
over the delicate hand she held out. Age had but
slightly spoiled her beauty; she had still a striking
presence, and a manner in which a trace of stateliness
was counterbalanced by gentle good-humor. Lisle
was strongly impressed, but, as Millicent noticed, he
betrayed no awkwardness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I seem to have heard your name before in connection
with Canada,&#8221; said Mrs. Gladwyne, confusing
it with his surname. &#8220;Ah, yes! Of course; it was
George&#8217;s guide I was thinking of.&#8221; She turned to
Millicent, adding in an audible aside: &#8220;I&#8217;ve a bad
habit of forgetting. Forgive me, my dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Everything considered, it was, perhaps, the most
awkward thing she could have said; but Lisle&#8217;s bronzed
face was imperturbable, and Gladwyne had promptly
recovered his composure as he realized the mistake.
Still, for a moment, he had been badly startled. Nobody
noticed Nasmyth, which was fortunate, because
his unnatural immobility would have betrayed him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d been expecting you both earlier; told you to
come to dinner,&#8221; said his host.
</p>
<p>Then he addressed Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As my mother mentioned, I had once something to
do with a man called Vernon, in Canada.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Knowing what he did, Lisle fancied that Gladwyne&#8217;s
indifferent tone had cost him an effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only my Christian name, as you have heard,&#8221;
he explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were up in the bush with Nasmyth, were you
not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Lisle. &#8220;I met him quite by
chance in a Victoria hotel when I happened to have
a few weeks at my disposal which I thought of spending
in the wilds. When he heard that I intended making
a trip through the northern part of the country
and suggested that we should go together I was glad
to consent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you belong to Victoria?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was located there when I met Nasmyth. Before
that I was up in the Yukon district for some time.
Since leaving him I&#8217;ve lived in the city.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thought Gladwyne was relieved at his answer,
for the latter smiled genially.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we must try to make your visit
to this country pleasant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Shortly after this, the group broke up and Gladwyne,
escaping from his guests, slipped out on to the
terrace and walked up and down. Nasmyth had
merely mentioned that he had a Canadian friend staying
with him; somehow a formal introduction had
been omitted during the day on the moors, and Gladwyne
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
had been badly disconcerted when he heard the
man addressed as Vernon. The name vividly recalled
a Canadian episode that he greatly desired to forget,
and he had, indeed, to some extent succeeded in doing
so. That unfortunate affair was done with, he had
assured himself; for two years it had scarcely been
mentioned in his hearing, but for a horrible moment
which had taxed his courage to the utmost he had
almost fancied that it was about to be brought to light
again. Lisle&#8217;s answer and manner had, however, reassured
him. Nasmyth had met the man accidentally
and it was merely as the result of this that they had
made the journey through the bush together. It was
evident that he had been needlessly alarmed.
</p>
<p>For all that, he was troubled. Living for his own
pleasure, as he did, he was nevertheless a man who
valued other people&#8217;s good opinion and prided himself
upon doing the correct and most graceful thing.
There was no doubt that he had once badly failed in
this, but it was in a moment of physical weakness,
when he was exhausted and famishing. After all, it
was most probable that his cousin had died before he
could have reached him, and there were, he thought,
few men who, if similarly situated, would have faced
the risk of the return journey. Still, the truth would
have had an ugly sound had it come out. This was
why he had spread the story of the guide&#8217;s defection,
which he now regretted. It might not have been
strictly necessary, but he had reached the trappers&#8217;
camp on the verge of a collapse, too far gone to reason
out the matter calmly. A man in that condition
could hardly be held accountable for his action. Besides,
it was incredible that the guide&#8217;s statement that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
he had made the journey without replenishing his provisions
could be correct.
</p>
<p>His reflections were interrupted by Mrs. Gladwyne,
who came out, wrapped in a shawl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you here alone?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You
look disturbed. Has anything gone wrong?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne was sorry that she had joined him where
the light from a window fell on his face, but he
smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered quietly, for he was always gentle
with her. &#8220;I only felt that I&#8217;d rather avoid the
chatter of the others for a few minutes. I suppose
it was the man&#8217;s name, together with your reference
to George, that upset me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne laid her hand on his arm. She was
inordinately fond and proud of the son whom she
had spoiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I sometimes think you are too sensitive on that
point, Clarence,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Of course, it was very
tragic and we both owe George a great deal, but you
did all that anybody could have done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man winced, and it was fortunate that they
had now left the light behind and his mother could
not see his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could have stayed and died with him,&#8221; he broke
out with unaffected bitterness. &#8220;There were times at
the beginning when I was sorry I let him send me
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne shook her head reproachfully. She
was gracious and quietly dignified and refined in
thought, but for all that she was not one to appreciate
such a sacrifice as he had indicated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that was an undue exaggeration of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
natural feeling,&#8221; she remonstrated. &#8220;How could
your staying have helped him, when by going in
search of help you increased his only chance of safety?
I have always been glad you were clear-headed enough
to realize it, instead of yielding to mistaken emotional
inclinations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne felt hot with shame. His mother had
an unshaken confidence in his honor, which was the
less surprising because her perceptions had never been
very keen and she had always shrunk from the contemplation
of unpleasant things. It was an amiable
weakness of hers to idealize those she loved, and by
resolutely shutting her eyes on occasions she succeeded
in accomplishing it more or less successfully. Clarence
was, of course, aware of this, and it hurt to remember
that in deserting his cousin he had been
prompted chiefly by craven fear. His mother, however,
quite unconscious of what she was doing, further
humiliated him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;if you had found the
cache of provisions, it would have been your duty to
return to George at any hazard, and I have no doubt
whatever that you would have gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The damp stood beaded on the man&#8217;s forehead. He
realized that even his lenient and indulgent mother
would shrink from him if she knew that he had abandoned
his dying benefactor like a treacherous coward.
He said nothing and they had strolled to the end of
the terrace before she spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would be better to go back to the others
and drive away these morbid ideas,&#8221; she advised.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a duty to look at the brightest side of everything.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>He made no answer, but he strove with some degree
of success to recover his usual tranquillity as they
turned toward the entrance of the hall.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Lisle had been talking to Millicent.
She had already made a marked impression on
him, for in the wilds the man had acquired a swift
and true insight into character. One has time to think
in the lonely places where, since life itself often depends
upon their accuracy, a man&#8217;s perceptions grow
keen, and though some of the minor complexities and
subtleties of modern civilization might have puzzled
him he was seldom mistaken in essentials.
</p>
<p>He liked her direct and calmly searching gaze; he
liked her voice which, while soft and pleasant, had a
trace of gravity in it. He knew that her fine carriage
was a sign of physical vigor and he recognized
how it had been gained by the clear, warm tinting of
her slightly sun-darkened skin. But, apart from this
and her comeliness, which was marked, there was that
in her personality which spoke of evenness and depth
of character. She was steadfast, not lightly to be
swayed from a resolve, he thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nasmyth has often spoken about you,&#8221; she told
him. &#8220;I understand it was chiefly by your help that
he succeeded in reaching the scene of my brother&#8217;s
death. I want to thank you for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her voice was quiet, but it did not betoken indifference;
he knew that she was not one to forget. He
could not think of any apposite answer, but she saw
the sympathy in his eyes and it pleased her more than
words would have done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a relief to me that Nasmyth made that
journey,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I wanted to learn everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
that could be known&mdash;instead of shrinking
from it. You see, I had a great faith in my brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He deserved it,&#8221; Lisle declared warmly. &#8220;I have
gathered enough to convince me of that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you! Clarence was not in a condition to
notice anything very clearly during his journey, and
I think what he suffered blunted his recollection. Besides,
the subject is a distressing one to him, and it is
seldom he can be induced to speak about it. Perhaps
that is a pity; I find it does not always save one
trouble in the end to avoid a little immediate pain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle was gratified. She had spoken so unrestrainedly,
though he imagined that it was a somewhat unusual
thing for her to take a stranger into her confidence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;I think that&#8217;s very true. It&#8217;s
better to face it and get it over. The wound sooner
heals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She smiled rather wistfully and changed the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told Nasmyth that you taught him to see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I did,&#8221; acknowledged Lisle. &#8220;Still, it
was only as far as it concerned the things that I&#8217;m
acquainted with. I&#8217;m not sure that my meaning&#8217;s
very clear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. You knew what to expect; that
carries one a long way. Were you disappointed in
finding it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was a little surprised at her keenness, and rather
confused. This was a question that could not be directly
answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I was more particularly referring to was
the meaning of such things as a broken branch, a gap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
in a thicket, or a few displaced stones,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;I taught him what to infer from those.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I understand that you discovered
nothing new&mdash;I mean nothing that could throw
any further light upon what befell my brother after
the others left him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was glad that he could answer her candidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; we can only suppose that the conclusions the
rescue party came to were correct. But all that we
found relating to the week or two before the separation
spoke of the courageous struggle that your
brother made and his generosity in sending the others
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She bent her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she said quietly, &#8220;is only what one would
have expected. He left a diary; you must come over
and see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to, if it wouldn&#8217;t be painful to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;I shall be glad to show it to
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She left him shortly after this and strolled out on
to the terrace, thinking about him. The little she had
seen of him had pleased her; he had earnest eyes and
a resolute air, and she liked the men who lived in the
open. He was direct, and perhaps a little rudimentary
without being awkward, which was in his favor, for
subtlety of any kind was distasteful to her. Still, in
one respect, she was disappointed&mdash;he had in no way
amplified Nasmyth&#8217;s story, and she had expected to
hear a little more of the expedition from him.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>LISLE GATHERS INFORMATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Nasmyth&#8217;s dinner was over and he lay, pipe
in hand, in an easy-chair in his smoking-room,
with Lisle lounging opposite him. They had
been walking up partridges among the higher turnip
fields all day, and now both were pleasantly tired and
filled with languid good-humor. Nasmyth&#8217;s house was
old&mdash;it had been built out of the remains of a Border
pele&mdash;and the room was paneled to the ceiling and
very simply furnished. It had an ancient look and
an ancient smell, and the few articles of plain oak
furniture harmonized with it. The window stood
wide open, and the fragrance of a grove of silver firs
outside drifted in. The surroundings had their effect
on Lisle, who had not been accustomed to dwellings
of that kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been here a fortnight and must have
formed a few opinions about us,&#8221; Nasmyth remarked
at length. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t be shy about expressing
them, and I&#8217;ve no doubt there are things you&#8217;d like to
ask.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a whole, my opinion&#8217;s highly favorable,&#8221; Lisle
announced with a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;d be uncommonly hard
to please if it weren&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s flattering. But I&#8217;m not sure that I meant
as a whole; I had a few particular instances in my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
mind. Bella Crestwick, for example; I&#8217;m curious to
hear what you think of her. She seems quite favorably
impressed with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s interesting,&#8221; Lisle replied. &#8220;A type that&#8217;s
new to me; the latest development, isn&#8217;t it? Anyway,
I like her&mdash;whatever the admission&#8217;s worth&mdash;though
I must say that I found her rather startling at first.
She&#8217;s honest, I think, and that counts for a good deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re not aware that she&#8217;s desirably
rich?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not a fact of any moment to me.
Besides, I&#8217;ve a suspicion that it&#8217;s Gladwyne&#8217;s scalp
she&#8217;s after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re pretty shrewd. Though I&#8217;ve had much
greater opportunities for observation, that idea has
only lately occurred to me. Of course, in a general
way, I shouldn&#8217;t discuss my acquaintances in this
casual fashion, but as you are likely to see a good
deal of us there are things you&#8217;d better know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain my point of view,&#8221; said Lisle, refilling
his pipe. &#8220;You have seen something of the kind
of life I&#8217;ve led. Half my time, I suppose, has been
spent in primeval surroundings; the rest in contact
with the latest efforts of a rather unfinished civilization.
Well, what you have to show me here is vastly
different. These old houses, your smoothed-down
ways, are a revelation to me. The polish on some of
your furniture has taken several hundred years to
put on; that in my Victoria quarters smells of the factory,
and the board walls of other hotels I&#8217;ve lived
in rend into big cracks because they&#8217;re fresh from
the mill. I&#8217;m full of interest; everything&#8217;s new to me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
But so far my curiosity&#8217;s impersonal; I&#8217;m taking no
hand in anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His companion&#8217;s face grew grave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that you may not be able to avoid
it later. You&#8217;re here, and some part will probably
be forced on you. However, as I said, I think you&#8217;re
right about Bella.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But her money would be no great inducement to
Gladwyne.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not certain. Clarence has a way of
squandering money, and you may as well understand
that there&#8217;s very little to be derived from agricultural
property. George had his mother&#8217;s money, but he
left it to Millicent; Clarence got only the land.
That&#8217;s what made a match between them seem so desirable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Desirable!&#8221; Lisle broke out. &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible!
Not to be contemplated!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Nasmyth agreed quietly. &#8220;If necessary,
it will have to be prevented. I was only stating popular
opinion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was something curious in his tone and Lisle
looked hard at him. Their eyes met full for a moment
and the thoughts of each were clear to the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything must be done, it will fall to you,&#8221;
Nasmyth went on. &#8220;In this case it would be particularly
invidious for me to interfere. But, if there had
been nobody else, I&#8217;d have broken off the match.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle made no comment, but there was comprehension
and sympathy in his expression, and Nasmyth
nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he acknowledged; &#8220;it&#8217;s an open secret that
I would have looked for nothing better than to marry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
Millicent Gladwyne.&#8221; He paused with a slight flush
creeping into his bronzed face. &#8220;For all that, I knew
some years ago that I hadn&#8217;t the faintest chance and
never would have. I have her confidence and friendship;
that has to be enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a good deal,&#8221; said Lisle.
</p>
<p>There was silence for a minute or two, and then
Lisle asked a question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could a girl like Millicent Gladwyne ever
contemplate the possibility of marrying Clarence?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s puzzling to me. These things often are to
outsiders. Still, Clarence is a handsome man, and I
think George was in favor of the match, which would
count with her. Then, in a way, she was always fond
of Clarence, and now that she has the money and he&#8217;s
far from prospering on the land, the idea that she
could set him firmly on his feet by sharing her possessions
with him may prove tempting. It&#8217;s very much
the sort of thing that would appeal to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You suggest that she isn&#8217;t strongly attached to
the man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really believe she isn&#8217;t; but, for all that, I&#8217;m
sometimes afraid she&#8217;ll end by marrying him. It&#8217;s
very probable that she suspects some of his faults,
but I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;d deter her. It would make her
more compassionate, believing it was her duty to help
him&mdash;that kind of thing&#8217;s an old delusion. Still, to
do the fellow justice, he hasn&#8217;t of late shown much
eagerness to profit by his opportunities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle mused for a few moments. It struck him
that Nasmyth had described a very fine type of woman,
which was quite in accordance with his own ideas of
Miss Gladwyne.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What led Gladwyne to cultivate Marple and the
Crestwicks?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;They&#8217;re different from the
rest of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say. It&#8217;s a point I&#8217;ve wondered about,
though Marple and his rather rowdy friends are prosperous.
I can better see why they got hold of Clarence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it,&#8221; responded Lisle. &#8220;Remember I&#8217;m
an unsophisticated stranger in search of information.
If they&#8217;ve means enough, can&#8217;t they associate with
whom they like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled, but there was a trace of diffidence
in his manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, you&#8217;re right; but there are limits, more
particularly in such a place as this. The counties,
I&#8217;m sometimes thankful, don&#8217;t keep pace with London.
It&#8217;s a little difficult to explain, but we&#8217;re old-fashioned
and possibly prejudiced here. Anyhow, we exercise a
certain amount of caution in the choice of our friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mrs. Gladwyne seems cordial to the people
you object to, and one would imagine that she&#8217;s the
embodiment of your best traditions, a worthy representative
of the old régime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gladwyne is a remarkably fine lady, but it&#8217;s
unfortunate that she&#8217;s a little deaf and&mdash;it must be
owned&mdash;not particularly intelligent. A good deal
of what goes on escapes her. Besides, she has always
idolized Clarence, and that would account for her not
seeing his friends&#8217; failings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s curious that Gladwyne makes so much of that
young Crestwick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wondered about it,&#8221; Nasmyth confessed.
&#8220;The lad&#8217;s vicious&mdash;and I&#8217;ve an idea that the influence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Clarence has over him isn&#8217;t beneficial. In fact,
I&#8217;m sorry for his sister. She has been given her head
too young, but, in my opinion, the girl&#8217;s the pick of a
very indifferent bunch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t accounted for these people&#8217;s
desire to be on good terms with Gladwyne.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth hesitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, since you&#8217;re so persistent, the Crestwicks
have evidently been left with ample means, acquired
by their parents, not much education, and big ambitions.
They can get into certain circles, but that
won&#8217;t content them, and other doors, which Gladwyne
can open to them, are shut. After all, he&#8217;s a good
sportsman, a man of some culture, with a manner
that&#8217;s likely to impress such people. The lad&#8217;s holding
on to him and taking his worst aspect for a copy,
while Clarence seems willing to extend his patronage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For some consideration?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked disturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unpleasant, but I can&#8217;t help feeling that
you&#8217;re right. One way or another, young Crestwick
will have to pay his entrance fees.&#8221; He rose and
stretched himself lazily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll spoil my temper if I
say any more about it, and as we&#8217;ve had a long day
I&#8217;m off to bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle followed him from the room, but he was up
early the next morning and strolled down to the river
while the light was creeping across the moors and the
dew lay thick upon the grass, thinking over what he
had heard on the previous night. It was his nature
to be interested in almost everything and he was
curious to learn what he could of the people to whom
his father had belonged. In Canada he had, for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
most part, met only men of somewhat primitive habits
and simple desires, grappling with rock and forest,
or with single purpose toiling to acquire wealth in
the new cities. What was more to the purpose, few
of them were married. Now he was thrown among
a people not more intelligent&mdash;indeed, he thought
they were less endowed with practically useful knowledge&mdash;but
in some respects more complex, actuated
by different and less obvious ambitions and desires.
He felt impelled to watch them, though he recognized
that, as Nasmyth had predicted, this might not be
all. It was possible that sooner or later he would be
drawn into action.
</p>
<p>He reached the stream at a spot where it flowed,
still and clear, beneath a birch wood. A few of the
leaves were green, but most of them gleamed a delicate
saffron among the gray and silver stems, and the
ground beneath was flecked with yellow. Behind the
trees rough, lichened rock and stony slopes ran up to a
bare ridge, silhouetted against the roseate glow of the
morning sky. The sun had not risen, the water lay
in shadow; it was very quiet and rather cold, and
Lisle was surprised to see Millicent Gladwyne picking
her way cautiously over a bank of stones. It was
only her movements that betrayed her, for her neutral-tinted
attire harmonized with the background; but
when she caught sight of him she left the foot of the
slope she was skirting and came directly toward him.
He thought she looked wonderfully fresh and wholesome,
and he noticed that she carried a small camera.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you have spoiled my sport,&#8221; she
laughed. &#8220;I was after an otter&mdash;though you
mustn&#8217;t tell Nasmyth that there is one about here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; acquiesced Lisle. &#8220;But why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He would consider it his duty to bring up the
hounds the next meet. Isn&#8217;t it curious how slaughter
appeals to a man? But Nasmyth isn&#8217;t unreasonable;
there are reserves in which even the jays he longs to
shoot have sanctuary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you were looking for an otter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I wanted its picture, not its life. I&#8217;ve got
several, but I&#8217;m not satisfied; though I&#8217;ve been lucky
lately. I got a dabchick&mdash;they&#8217;re growing scarce&mdash;not
long ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try the next pool, if you&#8217;ll let me come,&#8221;
suggested Lisle. &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty good at trailing. But
what do you want with their pictures?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For my book,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;I have to make
ever so many drawings in color before I get them
right. If you&#8217;re fond of the wild creatures, I&#8217;ll show
them to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle said that he would be delighted, and they went
on, keeping back among tall brushwood where they
skirted the swift stream at the head of the pool, and
then proceeding cautiously with the outline of their
figures softened by the heathy slopes behind. At
length, creeping up through a thin growth of alders,
they stopped near another still reach and the girl
pointed to a few floating objects on its surface.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re good at trailing or they&#8217;d have taken
fright,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Still, I think I will surprise you,
if you will wait here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mallard,&#8221; Lisle commented. &#8220;Young birds&mdash;even
where we seldom disturb them, they&#8217;re shy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She slipped away through the alders and he noticed
how little noise she made, though the lower branches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
here and there brushed against her gliding form. She
was wonderfully light and graceful in her movements.
As she came out into the open there was a startled
quack or two from the birds. Lisle expected to see
them rise from the water, but she called softly and, to
his vast astonishment, they ceased paddling away
from her. She called again and they turned and swam
cautiously toward her, and when she took a handful
of something from a pocket and flung it upon the
surface of the stream, three or four heads were
stretched forward to seize the morsels.
</p>
<p>While the birds drew nearer Lisle looked on admiring.
She had roused his interest when he had first seen
her in her rich evening dress, but now he thought she
made a far more striking picture, and her sympathy
with the timid wild creatures which evidently knew and
trusted her awakened something responsive in him.
Half the pool now glimmered in the rosy light, with
here and there an alder branch reflected upon its mirror-like
surface, and Millicent stood on a strip of
gravel with her figure clearly outlined against it.
Dressed in closely-fitting, soft-colored tweed, tall and
finely symmetrical, she harmonized with rock and flood
wonderfully well. Lisle had occasionally seen a bush
rancher&#8217;s daughter, armed with gun or fishing-rod,
look very much at home in similar surroundings; but
this English lady, of culture and station, reared in
civilized luxury, appeared equally in her right place.
</p>
<p>He afterward recollected each adjunct of the scene&mdash;the
stillness, the pale gleam of the water, and the
aromatic smell of fallen leaves, but the alluring, central
figure formed the sharpest memory. By and by
she clapped her hands, the ducks rose and flew away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
up-stream with necks stretched out, and she came back
toward him, laughing softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes they will come almost up to my feet;
but I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s hardly fair to inspire them with an
undue confidence in human nature. It might cost
them dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wonderful!&#8221; Lisle exclaimed, expressing
what he felt, for she seemed to him endowed with every
gracious quality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she smiled, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing really remarkable
in what I showed you. I happened to find the
nest and by slow degrees disarmed the mother bird&#8217;s
suspicions; mallard have been domesticated, you know,
though they&#8217;re often hard to get very near. But
we may as well turn back; it&#8217;s now too late to see an
otter. I&#8217;m inclined to think they&#8217;re the shyest of all
the British wild creatures.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They moved away down-stream side by side, and
some time later she left him where a stile-path crossed
a meadow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and see my drawings whenever you like,&#8221;
she said on parting.
</p>
<p>Lisle determined to go as soon as possible. Quite
apart from the drawings, the idea of going had its
attractions for him, and he walked homeward determined
that this girl should never marry Clarence Gladwyne.
It was unthinkable&mdash;that was the only word
for it.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>BELLA&#8217;S CHAMPION</h3>
</div>

<p>It was early in the afternoon when Lisle arrived
at Millicent&#8217;s house and, after a glance at its
quaint exterior, was ushered into her drawing-room.
There he sat down and looked about while he
waited. The salient tones of its decoration were white
and aqueous blue, and the effect struck him as pleasantly
chaste and cool. Among the rather mixed ornaments
were a couple of marble statuettes, the figures
airily poised and very finely wrought. Next, he
noticed some daintily carved objects in ivory, and a
picture in water-color of a wide, gray stretch of moor
with distance and solitude skilfully conveyed. He had
risen to examine it when Millicent entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you came, though, as you&#8217;re used to the
life of the woods and rivers, I&#8217;m a little diffident about
showing you my sketches,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve
kept you waiting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle smiled and she liked the candidly humorous
gleam in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nasmyth warned me that I was early&mdash;or rather
he said that if I were going to visit anybody else I
would have been too soon. I&#8217;d better confess, however,
that I&#8217;ve been making a good use of the time.
Things of this kind&#8221;&mdash;he indicated the statuettes&mdash;&#8220;are
almost new to me. They strike me as unusually
fine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, realizing that he had an artistic
eye, &#8220;they are beautiful&mdash;and one sees so many
that are not. George brought them from Italy for
me. This&#8221;&mdash;she moved toward a representation in
ivory of a Mogul gateway&mdash;&#8220;is of course a different
style, but it&#8217;s remarkable in its patient elaboration of
detail. The mosque&#8217;s not so fine. Nasmyth sent me
the pair from India; he once made a trip to the fringe
of the Himalayas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle examined the object carefully, and she waited
with some interest for his comment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s a
truthful copy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m inclined to think the man who carved that had
not the gift of imagination. He merely reproduced
faithfully what he saw.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Different peoples have strikingly different ways,
haven&#8217;t they?&#8221; commented Lisle. &#8220;While they were
making that small Eastern arch, we&#8217;d fling up a
thriving wooden town or build a hotel of steel and
cement to hold a thousand guests. The biggest
bridges that carry our great freight-trains across the
roaring gorges in the Rockies cost less labor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should imagine it. What then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He studied the carved ivory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a dry climate the original of this would last
for centuries&mdash;it has lasted since the days of the
Moguls&mdash;an object of beauty for generations to
enjoy. Perhaps those old builders used their time as
well as we do. Our works serve their purpose, but
one can&#8217;t call them pretty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was pleased with his answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that gets the strongest hold on me,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
went on, glancing toward the picture of the moor;
&#8220;it&#8217;s real!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a hint of diffidence in Millicent&#8217;s expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can hardly judge, can you? You have
scarcely seen the English moors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spent a while on the high Albertan plains,
and you have the same things yonder; the vast sweep
of sky, the rolling waste running on forever. It&#8217;s all
in that picture; how expressed, I don&#8217;t know&mdash;there
are only the grades of color, scarcely a line to gage
the distance by. Still, the sense of space is vivid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent blushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an indulgent critic; that drawing is my
own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not appear embarrassed, though she saw
that he had not suspected the fact. She had already
noticed that when he might, perhaps, have looked
awkward he only looked serious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After what you have said,&#8221; she resumed, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
show you the other things with greater confidence.
Do you know, I thought all you Western people were
grimly utilitarian?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat down and considered this. The man could
laugh readily, but he was also characterized by a certain
gravity, which she found refreshing by contrast
with the light glibness to which she was more accustomed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he reasoned, &#8220;in my opinion, the white
man&#8217;s greatest superiority over all other peoples is his
capacity for making useful things&mdash;even if they&#8217;re
only ugly sawmills or grimy locomotives. Philosophy
never fed any one or lightened anybody&#8217;s toil; commerce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
is a convenience, but the man who makes a big
profit out of it is only levying a heavy toll on somebody
else. It seems to me that all our actual benefits
come from the constructor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been building sawmills?&#8221; Millicent
asked mischievously.
</p>
<p>He laughed with open good-humor. &#8220;Oh, no;
that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m free to talk. I happened to find a
lode with some gold in it, and gold is only a handy
means of exchanging things. I&#8217;ll own that I was
probably doing more useful work when I stood up to
my waist in ice-water, fitting sharp stones into a pulp-mill
dam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re right,&#8221; Millicent agreed, &#8220;but it
sounds severe. What of the people who never do
anything directly useful at all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a few who, by just going up and down
in it, keep the world sweet and clean. Some of the
rest could very well be spared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you believe that everybody must practically
justify his existence?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he fails to do so with us, his existence generally
ceases. The wilderness where I found the gold is full
of the bones of the unfit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent spread out some drawings. Most were in
color, in some cases several of the same object, done
with patient care, and she was strangely pleased when
she saw the quick appreciation in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An otter; it&#8217;s alive,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
shown it working through a shallow, looking much
less like an animal than a fish&mdash;that&#8217;s right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I made half a dozen sketches, and I&#8217;m not satisfied
yet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thorough,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;You get there, if
you have to hammer the heart out of whatever you&#8217;re
up against.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my brother&#8217;s book,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m finishing
it for him. He did other things&mdash;most of
them useful, indirectly. I&#8217;ve only this&mdash;and I&#8217;d
like my part to be good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He nodded sympathetically, looking troubled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can understand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had a partner&mdash;I
owe him more than I could ever have repaid, and
he left a troublesome piece of work to me. It will
have to be put through. But let me see some more;
they&#8217;re great.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She showed him a red jay; a tiny gold-crest perched
on a thorn branch; a kingfisher gleaming with turquoise
hues, poised ready for a dive upon a froth-lapped
stone. He was no cultured critic, but he knew
the ways of the wild creatures and saw that she had
talent, for her representations of them were instinct
with life.
</p>
<p>They were interrupted by a scratching at the door
and when she opened it a white setter hobbled awkwardly
in and curled itself at her feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s rather a big dog for the house, but I can&#8217;t
keep him away from me,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;As you
see, he has lost a foot, in a trap, and he was marked
for destruction when I asked for him. Sometimes I
think he knows that I saved his life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The dog looked up and raising a paw scraped at
her hand, until she opened it, when he thrust his
chin into her palm. It was a trivial incident, but it
somehow stirred the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I know where you got power to draw these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
lesser brethren,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Study alone would never
have given it to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She let this pass. He was almost embarrassing in
his directness, though she acquitted him of any crude
intention of flattering her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised to let you read my brother&#8217;s diary,&#8221;
she reminded him. &#8220;If you will wait a few moments,
I&#8217;ll get it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The dog pattered after her, as though unwilling to
remain out of her sight, and she came back presently
with a small leather case and opening it took out a
tattered notebook. Noticing how she handled it and
that the case was beautifully made, Lisle fancied that
it was precious to her, in which he was correct. Indeed,
she was then wondering why she had volunteered
to show it to this stranger when only two of her intimate
friends had seen it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said, when she gave it to him;
and drawing his chair nearer the window he began to
read.
</p>
<p>Though he was already acquainted with most of it,
the story gripped him. On the surface, it was merely
a plain record of a hazardous and laborious journey;
but to one gifted with understanding it was more
than this&mdash;a vivid narrative of a struggle waged
against physical suffering, weakness, and hunger, by
optimistic human nature. An odd word here, a line
or two in another place, was eloquent of simple, steadfast
courage and endurance; and even when the weakening
man clearly knew that his end was near there
was no outbreak of desperation or sign of faltering.
He had dragged himself onward to the last, indomitable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Then Lisle proceeded to examine the book more
closely. It showed the effects of exposure to the
weather to an unusual degree, considering that the
covers were thick and that the rescue party had recovered
it shortly after its owner&#8217;s death. Moreover,
Lisle did not think that George Gladwyne would have
left it in the snow. Several pages were missing, and
having been over the ground, he knew that they recorded
the part of the journey during which the two
caches of provisions had been made, and he had
already decided that there would be a list of their contents.
This conclusion was confirmed by the fact that
Gladwyne had enumerated the stores they started with,
and had once or twice made a reduced list when they
had afterward taken stock. The abstraction of the
records was clearly Clarence&#8217;s work. Then he realized
that he had spent some time in perusing the diary and
he handed it back to Millicent with something that implied
a respect for it. She noticed the sparkle in his
eyes and her heart warmed toward him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the greatest story I&#8217;ve ever read,&#8221; he declared.
</p>
<p>She made no answer, but he knew that she was
pleased and it filled him with a wish to tell her that
she was very much like her dead brother. More he
could not have said, but remembering that he had
already gone as far as was permissible he had sense
enough to repress the inclination. He saw the girl&#8217;s
lips close firmly, as if she were conscious of some emotion,
but there was silence for a minute or two. He
broke it at length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that you have granted me a very great
privilege, and I&#8217;m grateful,&#8221; he told her, and added,
because he thought a partial change of the subject
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
might be considerate: &#8220;In a way, it&#8217;s hard to realize
that tale in this restful place. It&#8217;s easier out yonder,
where what you could call the general tone is different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nasmyth once said something like that,&#8221; Millicent
replied. &#8220;I suppose the change is marked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you have order, peace, security. In the
wilds, it&#8217;s all battle, the survival of the strong; frost
and ice rending the solid hills, rivers scoring out deep
ravines, beast destroying beast, or struggling with
starvation. Man&#8217;s not exempt either; a small blunder&mdash;a
deer missed or a flour bag lost&mdash;may cost him
his life. For the difference you have to thank the
constructor, the maker of plows and spades and more
complex machines.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of your pet hobbies, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He once more changed the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish that I could show you the wilderness,&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>Millicent looked thoughtful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to see it. I&#8217;ve an idea that if this
book is well received I might, perhaps, try something
a little more ambitious&mdash;the larger beasts and wilder
birds of other countries. In that case, I should choose
British Columbia.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will let me be your guide?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She made a conditional promise, and shortly afterward
he left her. Meeting Nasmyth he walked with
him toward Gladwyne&#8217;s house, where they found the
guests assembled on the lawn and Mrs. Gladwyne
sitting by a tea-table. One or two young women were
standing near and several men had gathered about a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
mat laid upon the grass fifty yards from where a
small target had been set up. Lisle joined Bella
Crestwick, who detached herself from the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very short
range.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miniature rifle shooting,&#8221; she informed him.
&#8220;It&#8217;s becoming popular. Gladwyne has been trying
to form a club. My brother Jim is president of some
league. He&#8217;s rather keen and there are reasons why
I&#8217;m glad of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She added the last words confidentially and Lisle
ventured to nod. It struck him that a healthy interest
in any organized work or amusement would be beneficial
to young Crestwick. The girl looked at him,
as if considering something; and then she seemed to
make up her mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing I don&#8217;t like,&#8221; she complained.
&#8220;They will shoot for high stakes. Jim isn&#8217;t a bad
shot, but he&#8217;s too eager. I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;s inclined to
be venturesome just now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle thought that she had a request to make.
There was something about him that inspired confidence,
and the girl had made a friend of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>She made a sign of impatience; he was too direct.
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she pouted, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you taking a good deal for
granted? Still, you bushmen can shoot, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a rule,&#8221; Lisle answered. &#8220;I almost think I
see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she retorted, &#8220;you shouldn&#8217;t have said so;
you should merely have smiled and acted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from the wilds; you mustn&#8217;t expect too much.
Well, if you&#8217;ll excuse me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>She flashed a grateful glance at him, and he sauntered
toward the group of men, among whom Gladwyne
stood. There was a sharp crack as he
approached them, a thin streak of smoke drifted across
the figure lying on the mat, and a man beside it lowered
the glasses he held.
</p>
<p>&#8220;High to the left,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;You&#8217;re not in
good form, Jim. Hadn&#8217;t you better give up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle studied the speaker, whom he had met once or
twice already. He was approaching middle-age and
was inclined to corpulence, but there was something in
his pose that suggested a military training. His face
was fleshy, but the features were bold and he was
coarsely handsome. As a rule, he affected an easy
good-humor, but Lisle had felt that there was something
about him which he could best describe as predatory.
He occasionally spoke of business ties, so he
had an occupation, but he had not in Lisle&#8217;s hearing
mentioned what it was.
</p>
<p>Crestwick&#8217;s face was hot as he answered his remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Batley. The trouble is that I&#8217;m used
to the Roberts target, and the spots on the card are
puzzling after the rings. I&#8217;ll get into it presently.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; acquiesced the other. &#8220;As you didn&#8217;t
fix a time limit, we&#8217;ll go on again, though it&#8217;s getting
tame and I want some tea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll increase the interest again, if you like,&#8221; the
lad replied.
</p>
<p>Lisle joined the group.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it all about?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Batley&#8217;s a pretty good rifle shot, but if he won&#8217;t
mind my saying so he&#8217;s a little opinionated,&#8221; Gladwyne
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
explained. &#8220;Crestwick questioned an idea of
his, and the end of it was that Batley offered to prove
his point&mdash;that a stiff pull-off is as good as a light
one in practised hands&mdash;by backing himself to beat
the field. Crestwick took him up, and since the rest
of us were obviously out of it, the thing has resolved
itself into a match between the two. Crestwick is
using an easy-triggered rifle; Batley&#8217;s has an unusually
hard spring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle considered. Remembering Bella&#8217;s remarks, he
thought it would be easy to lure the lad into a rash
bet. He was headstrong and his manners might have
been more conciliatory, but Lisle, learning the
amount of the stakes, decided that his host should not
have let the thing go so far.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Crestwick doubled several times; he&#8217;s stubborn and
doesn&#8217;t like to be beaten,&#8221; Gladwyne resumed. &#8220;I
had the same ideas when I was as young as he is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve offered to let him off,&#8221; Batley broke in. &#8220;I&#8217;d
do so now only he&#8217;s kept me shooting for the last half-hour.
As Gladwyne says, he&#8217;s obstinate, and it&#8217;s a
pity that he&#8217;s wrong. If he&#8217;d trained his wrist-tendons
by using a harder trigger, he&#8217;d have made a passably
good shot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle was aware that while there was something to
be said for Batley&#8217;s view, Crestwick was justified in
contending that the lighter tension was more adapted
to the case of the average person; but he recognized
that the indulgent manner of the older men was calculated,
he thought intentionally, to exasperate the
hot-headed lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he observed, addressing Batley, &#8220;you have
the courage of your convictions if you have offered to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
maintain them against all comers, which I understand
is what you have done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man nodded carelessly and Lisle went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, since I dare say these gentlemen are
more used to the shotgun, your superiority doesn&#8217;t
prove very much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick looked around at him quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of you Colonials can use the rifle; do you
feel inclined to take him on? You&#8217;re a dark horse,
but I&#8217;ll double the stakes if he&#8217;ll throw you in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was what Lisle wanted, but he turned to the
others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had a small rifle in my hands&mdash;we use
the 44-70, and I must leave you to decide whether
my shooting would be fair to Mr. Batley. In that
case, I&#8217;ll put up half the stakes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men said there was no reason why he should
not join, and Batley made no protest, though Lisle
fancied that he was not pleased. Lying down on the
mat, he took the light-springed rifle and the six cartridges
handed him and fixed his eyes on the target,
which was a playing-card pinned to a thick plank.
He got the first shot off before he was quite ready&mdash;the
light pull was new to him&mdash;and somebody called
that he had touched the left top corner. The next
shot was down at the bottom, and the four following
marks were scattered about the card. When he got
up, Batley looked reassured and proceeded to make
a neat pattern around the center of another card.
There was no doubt that Crestwick was anxious, and
when he took his turn he shot badly. In the meanwhile,
the rest of the party on the lawn had gradually
gathered round; the eager attitude of the original
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
spectators hinted that something out of the usual
course was going on.
</p>
<p>Lisle was very cool when he lay down again. A
swift, encouraging glance from Bella Crestwick made
him determined, and during his previous six shots he
had, he thought, learned the right tension on the
trigger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wipe it out for me, somebody,&#8221; he said, holding
up the rifle.
</p>
<p>Bella seized it and deftly used the rod, regardless
of soiled fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May it bring you luck,&#8221; she wished, with a defiant
glance at Batley, who smiled at her as she returned the
weapon.
</p>
<p>Then there was a hush of expectancy. Lisle took
his time; a sharp crack, a streak of smoke, and Gladwyne
raising his glasses, laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;High!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Top spot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a three of hearts, and Gladwyne&#8217;s smile lingered
for a moment after Lisle fired again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bottom now; you&#8217;re low!&#8221; he cried, and then his
expression slightly changed. Both spots were drilled
out&mdash;this did not look altogether like an accident.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Center!&#8221; he announced after another shot, and all
the faces surrounding him became intent. The three
hearts were neatly punched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fresh card!&#8221; exclaimed Crestwick, looking
around at Batley with an exultant sparkle in his eyes.
&#8220;You offered to let me off. Shall I return the compliment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man laughed carelessly, though Lisle thought
it cost him an effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he retorted; &#8220;I can&#8217;t show myself less of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
sportsman than you are; but I think I&#8217;ve the option
of demanding a longer range. Move the mat back
twenty-five yards and put up an ace of spades; it&#8217;s
the plainest. Three shots each should suffice at the
distance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick got down and thrice touched the outside
of the card; Batley did better, for two shots broke
the edge of the black and one was close above them.
It was good shooting at so small a mark, and Lisle
was a little anxious as he very deliberately stretched
himself out on the mat. Having little of the gambler&#8217;s
instinct in his nature, he was reluctant to lose
the money at stake, but he was more unwilling to let
Batley fleece the lad whom, as he recognized now, he
had been asked to aid. He meant to do so, if the
thing were possible, and twice he paused and relaxed
his grip when his sight grew slightly blurred.
</p>
<p>Then there was a sharp crack, and he smiled when
he heard Gladwyne&#8217;s report.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see it. These are only opera-glasses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dead silence followed the next shot, which left no
visible mark on the target; and Lisle did not look
around as he thrust his last cartridge into the rifle.
He let it lie beside him for half a minute while he
opened and shut his right hand, and then, taking it
up quickly, fired. Still there was no blur on the white
surface of the card and Gladwyne sharply shut his
glasses, while two of the onlookers ran toward the
target. They came back in silence and one significantly
held up the ace. There were three small holes
in the black center.
</p>
<p>Gladwyne had turned away when Lisle got up, but
Batley concealed his feelings very well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;As I can&#8217;t beat that,
the only thing left me is to pay up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle turned to Crestwick, who looked hot and excited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You made the bet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Will you use my
half in buying a competition cup for one of your
clubs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw Batley&#8217;s smile and a somewhat curious look
in Gladwyne&#8217;s face, but the group broke up and he
strolled back across the lawn with Bella.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful,&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;I was a little
afraid at first that I was asking too much of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle met her glance with a good assumption of surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grateful? Because I indulged in a rather enjoyable
match?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You learn rapidly. But I&#8217;d better say in excuse
that I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d involved you in a very serious
risk. He hasn&#8217;t your eyes and hands&mdash;one couldn&#8217;t
expect it. You don&#8217;t need pick-me-ups in the morning,
do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle was slightly embarrassed. This girl&#8217;s knowledge
of life was too extensive, and he would have
preferred that she should exhibit it to somebody else.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she concluded as they approached the tea-table,
&#8220;my thanks are yours, even if you don&#8217;t value
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you expect me to say?&#8221; he asked, regarding
her with some amusement and appreciation.
She was alluringly pretty in her rather elaborate light
dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she smiled mockingly, disregarding his question;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
&#8220;these things become me better than the tweeds,
don&#8217;t they? They make one look nice and soft and
fluffy; but that&#8217;s deceptive. You see, I can scratch;
in fact, I felt I could have scratched Batley badly if
I&#8217;d got the chance. There&#8217;s another hint for you&mdash;make
what you like of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then with a laugh she swung round and left him,
puzzled.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>CRESTWICK GIVES TROUBLE</h3>
</div>

<p>The little room in Marple&#8217;s house, where the
Crestwicks were staying, was hot and partly
filled with cigar smoke which drifted in filmy
streaks athwart the light of the green-shaded hanging-lamp.
Lisle sat beneath the lamp, studying the cards
in his hand, until he leaned back in his chair and flung
a glance about the table. There were no counters on
it, but Gladwyne had just noted something in a little
book and was waiting with a languid smile upon his
handsome face. Next to him sat Batley, looking
thoughtful; and Crestwick sat opposite Lisle, eager
and unhealthily flushed. His forehead showed damp
in the lamplight and there was an unpleasant glitter
in his eyes. It was close on to midnight and luck
had gone hard against him during the past hour, half
of which Lisle had spent in his company. This had
cost Lisle more money than he was willing to part with.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting late,&#8221; he said with a yawn. &#8220;After
this hand, I&#8217;ll drop out; I dare say one of the other
two will take my place. Crestwick, I believe your
sister and Miss Leslie will be waiting. You&#8217;re going
with them, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad, turning in his chair, reached toward a
near-by table on which there were bottles and siphons,
and took a glass from it. He had been invited to join
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
a shooting party at a house in the neighborhood and
was to spend the night there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he exclaimed with some irritation; &#8220;Bella&#8217;s
always in such an unreasonable hurry. The others
can&#8217;t be going yet. I think I hear Flo Marple singing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A voice from somewhere below reached them
through the open door. It was a good voice, but the
words were a silly jingle and the humor in them could
not be considered delicate. Lisle, glancing at Gladwyne,
noticed his slight frown, but one of the two
young men lounging by the second table watching the
game hummed the refrain with an appreciative smile
upon his heavy and somewhat fatuous face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll take half an hour to get ready,&#8221; declared
Batley. &#8220;Better play out this round, anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They laid down their cards in turn and then Crestwick
noisily thrust his chair back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another knock-out!&#8221; he exclaimed savagely. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like to get up so far behind. Shall we double
on another deal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you like,&#8221; returned Batley. &#8220;You&#8217;re plucky,
considering the cards you&#8217;ve had; but if Fortune&#8217;s
fickle, she&#8217;s supposed to favor a determined suitor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was innocent enough, but Lisle fancied that there
was sufficient flattery in the speech to incite the headstrong
lad, who had now emptied the glass at his
hand. He remembered that on another occasion when
there had been a good deal at stake, Batley had played
on Crestwick&#8217;s feelings, though in a slightly different
manner. Whether or not the young man lost
more than he could afford was, in one way, no concern
of Lisle&#8217;s, and he did not find him in the least attractive;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
but half an hour previously Bella had met
him in the hall and had hinted, with a troubled look,
that she would appreciate it if he could get her
brother away. It was this that accounted for the
Canadian&#8217;s presence in the card-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going, anyway,&#8221; he said, taking out some
notes and gold and laying them down. &#8220;There has
been a smart shower and you had better remember
that Miss Leslie walked over&mdash;the roads will be wet.
As you know, I promised to take the girls back in
Nasmyth&#8217;s trap, and he won&#8217;t thank me if I keep his
groom up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick grumbled and hesitated, and he grew
rather red in face as he turned to Batley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only these two notes,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Expected
all along I&#8217;d pull up even. Will you arrange
things? See you about it when I come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Batley nodded carelessly, and the lad stood up, looking
irresolutely at the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fact is,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to get straight
before I go. I&#8217;m in pretty heavy for one night; another
round might do something to set me straight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladwyne and I are quite willing to give you
your chance,&#8221; was Batley&#8217;s quick reply; but Lisle unceremoniously
laid his hand on Crestwick&#8217;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; he urged, laughing. &#8220;Luck&#8217;s
against you; you&#8217;ve had quite enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had the lad out of the door in another moment,
and looking back from the landing he saw a curious
look in Gladwyne&#8217;s face which he thought was one of
disgust. Batley, however, was frowning openly; and
the two men&#8217;s expressions had a meaning for him. He
was inclined to wonder whether he had used force
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
too ostensibly in ejecting the lad; but, after all, that
did not very much matter&mdash;his excuse was good
enough. As they went down the stairs, Crestwick
turned to him, hot and angry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me you&#8217;re pretty officious! Never saw
you until two or three weeks ago,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;Not accustomed to being treated in that offhand manner.
It&#8217;s Colonial, I suppose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; Lisle apologized with a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ve an
idea that you&#8217;ll be grateful when you cool off. You&#8217;ve
been going it pretty strong to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; agreed the other with a show of
pride. &#8220;Kept on raising them; made things lively!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Found it expensive, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Lisle suggested;
and as they reached the foot of the stairs he led his
companion toward the door. &#8220;Suppose we take a turn
along the terrace before we look for your sister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick went with him, but presently he stopped
and leaned on the low wall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you ever feel inclined for a flutter on the
stock-market?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;There&#8217;s a thing Batley
put me on to&mdash;there&#8217;ll be developments in a month
or two; it&#8217;s going to a big premium. Let you have a
hundred shares at par. Rather in a hole, temporarily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle had no intention of buying the stock, but he
asked a few questions. It appeared that it had been
issued by a new company formed to grow coffee and
rubber in the tropics.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said; &#8220;a deal of that kind is out
of my line. Why not sell them through a broker and
get your full profit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would take some days,&#8221; answered the other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
&#8220;Besides, they won&#8217;t move up until the directors let
things out at the next meeting. Something of that
kind, anyway; I forget&mdash;Batley explained it.&#8221; He
paused and added irritably: &#8220;Believe I told you I&#8217;m
in a hole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must meet your losses and don&#8217;t know how to
manage it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle was curious and had no diffidence about putting
the question, though the lad was obviously off his
guard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can raise the money right enough&mdash;Batley&#8217;ll
see to that; but I&#8217;d sooner do it another way. The interest&#8217;s
high enough to make one think, and in this
case I&#8217;m paying it on money he&#8217;s putting into his
pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a good deal to be inferred from this reply,
but Lisle considered before he spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re twenty-one, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented the lad, &#8220;but the trustees keep hold
until I&#8217;m twenty-four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned with quick suspicion to the Canadian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what that has to do with you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t very obvious,&#8221; Lisle agreed. &#8220;Shall we
go in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They found Bella in the hall, and when her brother
went to get-his coat she walked out on to the terrace
with Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said gratefully when they were
out of sight from the hall. &#8220;It was a relief to see
you had succeeded in getting him away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I was unable to do so sooner,&#8221; Lisle replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Then he has been losing heavily again?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so. I couldn&#8217;t make my interference
too marked.&#8221; Obeying some impulse, he laid his hand
on her arm. &#8220;Rather a handful for you, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella nodded, making no attempt to shake off his
grasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she acknowledged with some bitterness;
&#8220;but I can hardly complain that I have no control
over him. It would be astonishing if I had.&#8221; She
broke into a little harsh laugh. &#8220;Anyway, I manage
to keep my head, and do not deceive myself, as he
does. I know what our welcome&#8217;s worth and what the
few people whose opinion counts for anything think
of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; offered Lisle, &#8220;if I can be of service in any
respect&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; she interrupted, and turned back toward
the door.
</p>
<p>When they reached the hall she glanced at her companion
as the light fell on his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your offer&#8217;s genuine,&#8221; she said impulsively. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t see what you expect in return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle was puzzled by her expression. She was variable
in her moods, generally somewhat daring, and
addicted to light mockery. He could not tell whether
she spoke in bitterness or in mischief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied gravely, &#8220;nor do I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She left him with a laugh; and a little later he drove
her and her companions away and afterward returned
to Nasmyth&#8217;s house to find that his host had retired.
Lisle followed his example and rising early the next
morning they set off for the river, up which the sea-trout
were running. They were busy all morning and
it was not until noon, when they lay in the sunshine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
eating their lunch on a bank of gravel, that either of
them made any allusion to the previous evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you enjoy yourself last night?&#8221; Nasmyth
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairly,&#8221; Lisle responded, smiling. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already
confessed that you people interest me. At the same
time, I had my difficulties&mdash;first of all to explain to
the Marples why you didn&#8217;t come. The reasons you
gave didn&#8217;t sound convincing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were good enough. It&#8217;s probable that Marple
understood them. Like most of my neighbors, I
go once or twice in a year; his subscription to the otter
hounds entitles him to that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t look at things in that way in the parts of
Canada I&#8217;m acquainted with,&#8221; laughed Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ve no doubt you&#8217;ll come to it,&#8221; Nasmyth
replied with some dryness. &#8220;They&#8217;ve done so already
in the older cities. Now&mdash;since you&#8217;re fond of candor&mdash;you
have been glad to earn a dollar or two a day
by chopping and shoveling, haven&#8217;t you? Have you
felt left out in the cold at all during the little while you
have spent among us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; Lisle owned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can infer what you like from that. In
this country, we take a good deal for granted and avoid
explanations. But you haven&#8217;t said anything about
the proceedings at Marple&#8217;s. I suppose you were invited
to take a hand at cards?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I invited myself; result, sixty dollars to the bad
in half an hour. I used to hold my own in our mining
camps, and I hadn&#8217;t the worst cards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed with unconcealed enjoyment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only fault I have to find with you Westerners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
is that you&#8217;re rather apt to overrate yourselves. I
suppose they let young Crestwick in a good deal
deeper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; laughed Lisle, &#8220;is what you have been leading
up to from the beginning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit it. As I&#8217;ve hinted, one of the differences
between an American and an Englishman is that the
former usually expresses more or less forcibly what he
thinks, unless, of course, he&#8217;s a financier or a politician;
while you have often to learn by experience what the
latter means. Better use your own methods in telling
me what took place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle did so, omitting any reference to Bella, and
Nasmyth looked disturbed and disgusted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Crestwick&#8217;s as devoid of sense as he is of manners;
he deserves to lose. What I can&#8217;t get over is that
fellow Batley&#8217;s staying in what was once George Gladwyne&#8217;s
house, with Clarence standing sponsor for
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle fancied he could understand. Nasmyth had
his failings, but he had also his simple, drastic code, and
it was repugnant to him that a man of his own caste,
one of a family he had long known and respected,
should countenance an outsider of Batley&#8217;s kind and
assist him in fleecing a silly vicious lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no reason to think well of Gladwyne,&#8221;
Lisle reminded him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; Nasmyth owned. &#8220;Still, though the
man has made one very bad break, I hardly expected
him to exceed every limit. At present it looks as if he
might do so; he&#8217;ll probably be forced to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have to explain. It&#8217;s unpleasant, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
here the thing is, as I see it&mdash;Batley&#8217;s not the kind of
man Clarence would willingly associate with, and to
give Clarence his dues, all his instinct must make him recoil
from the fellow&#8217;s game with Crestwick. Considering
that he&#8217;s apparently making no protest against it,
this is proof to me that Batley has some pretty firm hold
on him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Batley&#8217;s profession?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspect he&#8217;s something in the smart money-lending
line; one of the fellows who deal with minors and
others on post-obits.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Post-obits?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Promises to pay after somebody&#8217;s dead. Suppose
there should be only an invalid or an old man between
you and a valuable property; you could borrow on the
strength of your expectations. Now, what Crestwick
told you shows that the person who left him his money
very wisely handed it to trustees, with instructions to
pay him only an allowance until he&#8217;s twenty-four. It&#8217;s
a somewhat similar case to the one I&#8217;ve instanced&mdash;he&#8217;s
drawing on a capital he can&#8217;t get possession of for
two or three years, and no doubt paying an extortionate
interest. So far as I know, no respectable bank or
finance broker would handle that kind of business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if the boy died before he succeeded to the
property?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Batley could cover the risk by making Crestwick
take out an insurance policy in his favor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle&#8217;s face grew stern, and Nasmyth lay smoking in
silence for a while. Then he broke out again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s intolerable! George Gladwyne&#8217;s successor
abetting that fellow in robbing the lad, luring him into
wagers and reckless play with the result that most of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
the borrowed money goes straight back into the hands
of the man who lent it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any suspicion that Gladwyne gets a
share?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Nasmyth, with signs of strong uneasiness;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe he benefits in that manner&mdash;if
he did, I&#8217;d feel it my duty to denounce him. Still,
I expect he wins a little now and then, incidentally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again there was silence for a while, broken finally
by Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;d been here a week or two I began to see
that my task wasn&#8217;t quite so simple as it had appeared&mdash;you
can&#8217;t attack a man situated as Gladwyne is
without hurting innocent people. Indeed, I&#8217;ve spent
hours wondering how, when the time comes, I can clear
Vernon&#8217;s memory, with the least possible damage&mdash;that
is my business, not the punishing of Gladwyne,
though he deserves no consideration. As you say, a
man may make a bad break and pull up again, but this
one has had his chance and has gone in deeper. What
he&#8217;s doing now&mdash;helping to ruin that lad in cold-blood&mdash;is
almost worse than the other offense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth made an acquiescent gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true; let it go at that. I don&#8217;t see how the
thing can be stopped. There&#8217;s a fish rising in the
slack yonder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle saw a silvery gleam in a strip of less-troubled
water behind a boulder and taking up his rod he cast
the gaudy fly across the ripple. There was a jar, a
musical clinking of the reel, and when Nasmyth waded
in with ready net all thought of Gladwyne passed out
of the Canadian&#8217;s mind.
</p>
<p>After a few minutes&#8217; keen excitement, they landed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
the beautiful glistening trout; and then they set off
down-stream in search of another, scrambling over
rock and gravel and wading amidst the froth in the
pools. Overhead, soft gray clouds drifted by, casting
long shadows across fern-clad hillside and far-reaching
moor; and the flood flashed into silver gleams and
grew dim again.
</p>
<p>Both of the men were well content with their surroundings,
and now and then Nasmyth wondered why
Clarence could not be satisfied with the simple pleasures
that were freely offered him. He could have had
the esteem of his neighbors and the good will of his
tenants, and there were healthful tasks that would
have kept him occupied&mdash;the care of his estate, the
improving of the homes and conditions of life of those
who worked for him, experiments in stock-raising, local
public duties. He had once slipped badly, so badly
that the offense could hardly be contemplated; but that
was when he was weak and famishing and under the
influence of an overwhelming fear. At least, he could
make some reparation by leaving the countryside better
than he found it, and in this he had friends who
would loyally assist him.
</p>
<p>Clarence, however, had chosen another way, one that
led down-hill to further dishonor; and Nasmyth considered
gloomily what the end of it all would be. Occasionally
he glanced at the lithe figure of the Canadian,
standing knee-deep amid the froth of the stream.
Serious-eyed, alert, resolute, he could be depended on
to carry out any purpose he had determined on; it
was his firm hands that would hold Clarence&#8217;s scourge.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>MRS. GLADWYNE&#8217;S APPEAL</h3>
</div>

<p>Millicent was sitting in a window-seat with
a paint-box beside her and a drawing of a
water-ouzel upon her knee. It was a lifelike
sketch, but she had a great capacity for painstaking
and she was not altogether pleased with the drawing.
The bird stood on a stone an inch or two above a
stream, its white breast harmonizing with the flecks of
snowy froth, and the rest of its rather somber plumage
of the same hue as a neighboring patch of shadow.
This was as it should be, except that, as the central
object of a picture, it was too inconspicuous. She
was absorbed in contemplating it when Mrs. Gladwyne
was shown in. Clarence&#8217;s mother did not pay many
visits and Millicent fancied she had some particular object
in coming.
</p>
<p>She sat down where the sunlight fell on her gentle
face and silvery hair, her delicate white hands spread
out on her dark dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Busy, as usual, my dear,&#8221; she said, glancing at
the sketch. &#8220;That&#8217;s very pretty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s correct,&#8221; returned Millicent; &#8220;but I&#8217;m
not sure it&#8217;s what it ought to be in other respects.
You see, its purpose is to show people what a water-ouzel
is like and it&#8217;s hard to make the creature out.
Of course, I could have drawn it against a background
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
that would have forced up every line, but that wouldn&#8217;t
have been right&mdash;these wild things were made to fade
into their surroundings.&#8221; She laughed. &#8220;Truth is
rigid and uncompromising&mdash;it&#8217;s difficult to make it
subservient to expediency.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her visitor did not feel inclined to discuss the matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too fastidious,&#8221; she smiled, and added with
a sigh: &#8220;George was like that. Little things keep
cropping up every day to show it&mdash;I mean in connection
with his care of the property. I&#8217;m sometimes
afraid that Clarence is different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent could not deny this, but she did not see
his mother&#8217;s purpose in confessing it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she answered, as she rang for tea,
&#8220;he hasn&#8217;t been in charge very long. One can learn
only by experience.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne looked grateful; but although she
was very tranquil there was something in her manner
that hinted at uncertainty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will finish the book and these pictures some
day,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What will you do then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know. Perhaps I shall start another.
If not, there is always something I can turn
my hand to. So many things seem to need doing&mdash;village
matters alone would find me some occupation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The elder lady considered this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she agreed with diffidence. &#8220;I&#8217;m now and
then afraid everything&#8217;s not quite so satisfactory as it
used to be. The cottages don&#8217;t look so pretty or well
cared for, the people are not so content&mdash;some of
them are even inclined to be bitter and resentful. Of
course, things change, our relations with our dependents
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
among them; but I feel that people like the Marples,
living as they do, have a bad effect. They form
a text for the dissatisfied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent contented herself with a nod. She could
not explain that in spite of the changing mode of
thought it is still possible for an old-fashioned landlord
to retain almost everybody&#8217;s good will. Sympathy
and tactful advice are appreciated, though not effusively,
and even a bluff, well-meant reproof is seldom
resented. But when rents are rigorously exacted by a
solicitor&#8217;s or banker&#8217;s clerk, and repairs are cut down,
when indifference takes the place of judicious interest,
it is hardly logical to look for the cordial relations that
might exist. Nasmyth&#8217;s tenants stopped and exchanged
a cheery greeting or a jest with him; most of
Gladwyne&#8217;s looked grim when he or his friends, the
Marples, passed.
</p>
<p>Then tea was brought in and Millicent found pleasure
in watching her guest. Mrs. Gladwyne made a
picture, she thought, sitting with the dainty china in
her beautiful hands; she possessed the grace and something
of the stateliness which is associated with the
old régime.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How quick your people are,&#8221; she commented.
&#8220;You rang and the things were brought in. Our
staff is large and expensive, but as a rule they keep
us waiting. Though you paint and go out so much,
you have the gift of making a home comfortable. It
really is a gift; one that should not be wasted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent grew serious. It looked as if her companion
were coming to the point, and this became
plainer when Mrs. Gladwyne proceeded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think the life you contemplate&mdash;writing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
books on birds and animals&mdash;is the best or most natural
one for a woman?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little color crept into the girl&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; perhaps it isn&#8217;t. It is the one that
seems open to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only one, my dear? You must know what I
mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent turned and faced her. She was disturbed,
but she seldom avoided a plain issue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it would be better if you told
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult.&#8221; Mrs. Gladwyne hesitated. &#8220;You
must forgive me if I go wrong. Still, you know it
was always expected that you would marry Clarence
some day. It would be so desirable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For which of us?&#8221; Millicent&#8217;s tone was sharp.
She sympathized with Mrs. Gladwyne, but something
was due to herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Clarence that I was thinking of,&#8221; admitted
her visitor. &#8220;I suppose that I am selfish; but I am
his mother.&#8221; She laid down her cup and looked at
the girl with pleading eyes. &#8220;I must go on, though
I don&#8217;t think I could say what I wish to any one but
you. Clarence has many good qualities, but he needs
guidance. An affectionate son; but it is my misfortune
that I am not wise or firm enough to advise or
restrain him. I have dropped behind the new generation;
the standards are different from what they were
when I was young.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was true, but it was incomplete, and Millicent
let her finish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been a little anxious, perhaps foolishly so,
about him now and then. I cannot approve of all his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
friends&mdash;sometimes they jar on me&mdash;and I do not
like the views he seems to have acquired from them.
They are not the ones his father held. Of course, this
is only the result of wrong associations and of having
a good-humored, careless nature; it would be so different
if he could be brought under some wholesome influence.&#8221;
She smiled at Millicent. &#8220;One could trust
implicitly to yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was an old plea, fallacious often, but none the
less effective. Millicent was devoid of officious self-righteousness,
but she was endowed with a compassionate
tenderness which prompted her to extend help
to all who needed it. She thought that Clarence did
so, but in spite of that she did not feel so responsive as
she could have wished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one difficulty,&#8221; she answered while the
blood crept into her face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll own that I recognized
what your ideas and George&#8217;s were about Clarence and
myself. I may go so far. But of late there has been
nothing to show that Clarence desired to carry out
those ideas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne gathered her courage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, it is rather hard to say, but the truth is
that a declaration from a man is not usually quite
spontaneous. He looks for some tacit encouragement,
a sign that one is not altogether indifferent to him.
Now it has struck me that during the past year you
have rather stood aloof from my son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent started slightly; there was some truth in
this statement. Mrs. Gladwyne, however, was not wise
enough to stop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is why there is some risk of his falling
into bad hands&mdash;that Crestwick girl isn&#8217;t diffident,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
she went on. &#8220;I know the strong regard he has for
you; but the girl sees a good deal of him, and a man
is sometimes easily led where he does not mean to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent&#8217;s cheeks burned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish me to compete openly for Clarence&#8217;s
favor with Bella Crestwick?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne spread out her hands in protest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I have said the
wrong thing. I warned you that you might have to
forgive me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the thought must have been in your mind!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only meant that you needn&#8217;t repel or avoid him,
as you have done of late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent felt compassionate. After all, Mrs.
Gladwyne was pleading for what she believed would
benefit her only son; but the girl was very human
and a trace of her resentment remained. It was,
however, obvious that Mrs. Gladwyne expected some
response.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can venture to promise that I won&#8217;t be openly
rude,&#8221; Millicent agreed with a faint smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you go a little beyond that, my dear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl, seeing the look in her eyes, yielded to an
impulse which prompted her to candor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What there is to be said had better be spoken
now,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I have confessed that I knew
what was expected&mdash;Clarence showed that he knew it,
too&mdash;and the idea was not altogether repugnant to
me. But since he came back from Canada there has
been a change in both of us. How or why I can&#8217;t explain,
but we have drifted apart. I don&#8217;t know
whether this will go on&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand myself&mdash;I
only know that I am as anxious for his welfare as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
I always have been. It must be left to him; there is
nothing you must urge me to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne looked regretful, but she made a
sign of acquiescence and rising came toward the girl
and took her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I could do I have done&mdash;badly perhaps,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t blame you. I am only sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She went out in a few minutes and left Millicent in
a thoughtful mood. Looking back on the past, the
girl recognized that she had been fond of Clarence&mdash;which
was the best word for it&mdash;and that she would
have married him had he urged it. He had, however,
hardly been in a position to do so then, and she remembered
that she had in no way regretted the fact.
This was, she thought, significant. Then the change
had gradually come about. She saw his faults more
clearly and it grew increasingly difficult to believe that
she could eradicate them. What was more, during the
past few weeks she had once or twice felt scornfully
angry with him. She had tried not to yield to the
sensation, and now she wondered how it had originated
and why she was less tolerant.
</p>
<p>As she considered the question, a shadow fell upon
the sunlit lawn and looking up she saw Lisle approaching
with a creel upon his back. She started at the
sight of him and once more felt her cheeks grow hot;
then she smiled, for the half-formed suspicion that had
flashed into her mind was obviously absurd. He saw
her the next moment and strode toward the open window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We got a few good white trout, fresh run,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It occurred to me that you might like one or
two of them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>He glanced at the long French window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come in this way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt you could do so, but out of deference
to conventional prejudices it might be better if
you went round by the usual entrance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Charmed!&#8221; he smiled. &#8220;That&#8217;s easy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you rather have it hard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t the idea,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I only felt
that a much greater difficulty wouldn&#8217;t stop my getting
in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If one of my neighbors made such speeches, they&#8217;d
sound cheap. From you they&#8217;re amusing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He affected to consider this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the difference is that I mean them.
Anyway, I&#8217;ll walk around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She gave him some tea when he came in, and afterward
admired the fish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re well above the average weight,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had two or three that would beat them,&#8221; Lisle
declared. &#8220;Miss Crestwick came along and corralled
the finest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the explanation essential?&#8221; Millicent inquired
with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a bad break of mine. So bad that I
won&#8217;t try to explain it away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are wise,&#8221; Millicent retorted with a
trace of dryness.
</p>
<p>On the face of it, she was pleased with his answer,
but the fact he had mentioned caused her some irritation.
Bella Crestwick, not content with monopolizing
Clarence, must also seek to include the Canadian in
her train. It was curious that for the moment that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
seemed the more serious offense. The girl was insatiable
and going too far, Millicent thought.
</p>
<p>Lisle noticed her silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that I&#8217;m from the wilds,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>She smiled at him reassuringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, that isn&#8217;t a great drawback. Anyway,
I&#8217;m grateful for the trout.&#8221; Then, somewhat to his
surprise, she abruptly changed the subject. &#8220;I wonder
what you think of a tacit promise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His face grew thoughtful; she liked his quick change
to seriousness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know that my opinion&#8217;s of much
value, but you may have it. Supposing two people
allow each other to assume that they&#8217;re agreed upon
the same thing, it&#8217;s binding upon both of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if only one actually made his wishes clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, the other had the option of showing
that they couldn&#8217;t be acceded to. Failing that, in
my view, he can&#8217;t go back on it.&#8221; Then his eyes
gleamed with amusement. &#8220;I don&#8217;t often set up as a
philosopher.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent was a little vexed with herself for asking
him and did not quite understand why she had done so,
unless it was because she had not altogether recovered
her usual collectedness after Mrs. Gladwyne&#8217;s visit.
Why she should be interested in this man&#8217;s opinion
was not clear, but she thought he was one who would
act in accordance with it. She was afterward even
more astonished at her next remark, which she made
impulsively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen a good deal of Miss Crestwick,
one way or another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He considered this gravely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I like her. For one thing,
she&#8217;s genuinely concerned about that brother of hers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; Lisle answered candidly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no
use for a man who needs a woman to keep him straight
and look after him. But one feels a strong respect
for the woman, even though it&#8217;s obvious that she&#8217;s
wasting her time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it wasting time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me like that. A man of that sort is
bound to come down badly some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent sat silent a while. The conversation had
taken an unusually serious turn, but she wondered
whether he were right. She had, she thought, allowed
Clarence to assume that she would not repulse him
when he formally claimed her and that&mdash;so this man
from the wilds considered&mdash;constituted a binding obligation.
She could not contest this view; but Clarence
seemed more interested in Bella Crestwick than
he was in her. Then she wondered why the girl had
made so much of Lisle, unless it was to use him for
the purpose of drawing Clarence on. If that were
so, it seemed a pity that the confiding Canadian could
not be warned, though that, of course, was out of the
question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m not very amusing to-day,&#8221; she acknowledged.
</p>
<p>He smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go the moment you want to get rid of me; but,
even if you don&#8217;t say anything, I like sitting here.
This place rests me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have imagined you to be of a very
restful nature.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;there&#8217;s a kind of quietness that
braces you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was less reserved than the average Englishman,
but he felt the charm of his surroundings more keenly
than the latter would probably have done. Everything
in the room was artistic, but its effect was deeper
than mere prettiness. It was cool, though the autumn
sunshine streamed in, and the girl had somehow impressed
her personality upon it. Soft colorings, furniture,
even the rather incongruous mixture of statuettes
and ivory carvings, blended into a harmonious
whole, and the girl made a most satisfactory central
figure, as she sat opposite him in her unusually
thoughtful mood. He felt the charm of her presence,
though he could hardly have analyzed it. As he said,
it was not even needful that she should talk to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are lakes in British Columbia from which
you can look straight up at the never-melting snows,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;You feel that you could sit there for
hours, without wanting to move or speak, though it
must be owned that one very seldom gets the opportunity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Millicent inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a rule, the people who visit such places are
kept too busy chopping big trees, hauling canoes
round rapids, or handling heavy rocks. Besides, you
have your food to cook and your clothes to mend and
wash.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, after the day&#8217;s labor, a man must do his
own domestic work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; answered Lisle. &#8220;Now and then one
comes back to camp too wet or played out to worry,
and goes to sleep without getting supper. I&#8217;m speaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
of when you&#8217;re working for your own hand. In
a big logging or construction camp you reach the
fringe of cooperation. This man sticks to the saw,
the other to the ax, somebody else who gets his share
of the proceeds chops the cord-wood and does the
cooking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you can neither chop nor saw nor cook?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Lisle informed her dryly, &#8220;you have to
pull out pretty quick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds severe; that&#8217;s cooperation in its grimmest
aspect, though it&#8217;s quite logical&mdash;everybody
must do his part. I&#8217;m afraid I shouldn&#8217;t be justified
if we adopted it here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cooperation implies a division of tasks,&#8221; Lisle
pointed out. &#8220;In a country like this, they&#8217;re many
and varied. So long as you draw the wild things as
you do, you&#8217;ll discharge your debt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that that&#8217;s the kind of work the community
generally pays one very little for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it shows its wrong-headedness,&#8221; Lisle answered
as he glanced meaningly round the room. &#8220;But
haven&#8217;t you got part of your fee already? Of course,
that&#8217;s impertinent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we would shrink from saying it, but it&#8217;s
quite correct,&#8221; Millicent replied. &#8220;Still, since you
have mentioned the drawings, I&#8217;d like your opinion
about this ouzel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took up the sketch and explained the difficulty,
as she had done to Mrs. Gladwyne.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s right; don&#8217;t alter it,&#8221; advised Lisle. &#8220;It&#8217;s
your business to show people the real thing as it actually
is, so they can learn, not to alter it to suit their
untrained views.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>He laughed and rose somewhat reluctantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After that, I&#8217;d better get along. I have to thank
you for allowing me to come in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She let him go with a friendly smile, and then sat
down to think about him. He was rather direct, but
the good-humor with which he stated his opinions
softened their positiveness. Besides, she had invited
them; and she felt that they were correct. He was
such another as Nasmyth, simple in some respects, but
reliable; one who could never be guilty of anything
mean. She liked the type in general, and she admitted
that she liked this representative of it in particular.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A FUTILE PROTEST</h3>
</div>

<p>It was late at night, but Gladwyne sat, cigar in
hand, in his library, while Batley lounged beside
the hearth. A wood fire diffused a faint aromatic
fragrance into the great high-ceilinged room, and
the light of a single silver lamp flickered on the polished
floor, which ran back like a sheet of black ice
into the shadow. Heavily-corniced bookcases rose
above it on either band, conveying an idea of space
and distance by the way they grew dimmer as they
receded from the light.
</p>
<p>The room had an air of stateliness in its severe simplicity,
and its owner, sitting just inside the ring of
brightness, clad in conventional black and white, looked
in harmony with it. Something in his finely-lined figure
and cleanly-molded face stamped him as one at
home in such a place. A decanter stood near his elbow,
but it was almost full. Gladwyne, in many ways, was
more of an ascetic than a sensualist, though this was
less the result of moral convictions than of a fastidious
temperament. The man had an instinctive aversion
for anything that was ugly or unpleasant. His
companion, dressed with an equal precision, looked different,
more virile, coarser; he was fuller in figure and
heavier in face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; declared Gladwyne with a show of firmness;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
&#8220;the line must be drawn. I&#8217;ve already gone farther
than I should have done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for you, Gladwyne&mdash;you don&#8217;t seem
to realize that a man can&#8217;t very well play two widely
different parts at once,&#8221; Batley rejoined, smiling.
&#8220;Your interfering Canadian friend would describe your
attitude as sitting upon the fence. It&#8217;s an uncomfortable
position, one that&#8217;s not often tenable for any
length of time. Hadn&#8217;t you better make up your mind
as to which side you&#8217;ll get down on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne looked uneasy. The choice all his instinct
prompted him to make was not open to him, except at
a cost which he was hardly prepared to face. He was
known as a bold rider, he had the steady nerves that
usually result from a life spent in the open air, but, as
Batley recognized, he lacked stamina.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going wide of the mark,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;What I have asked you to do is to let the lad alone.
The thing&#8217;s exciting comment. You&#8221;&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;&#8220;have
made enough out of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; replied the other coolly, &#8220;I was very
much to the point. If you don&#8217;t recognize this, I&#8217;ll
ask: Suppose I don&#8217;t fall in with your request, what
then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne examined his cigar. It was not in his nature
to face an issue boldly, and his companion seemed
determined to force one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve asked it as a favor,&#8221; he finally said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; corrected Batley; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you did so.
You intimated your wishes in a rather lordly style.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was true, but Gladwyne winced at the man&#8217;s
cold smile. He had, in a fit of indignation which was
both honest and commendable, expressed himself with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
some haughtiness; but he knew that he would be beaten
if it came to an open fight. This was unfortunate, because
his intentions were good.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; Batley continued, &#8220;I&#8217;m not in a position
to grant expensive favors. My acquaintance with
young Crestwick is, of course, profitable. What&#8217;s
more, I&#8217;ve very liberally offered you a share.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne&#8217;s face grew hot. He had acted, most reluctantly,
as a decoy to the vicious lad, but he had
never benefited by it, except when now and then some
stake fell into his hands. The suggestion that he
should share in the plunder filled him with disgust, and
he knew that Batley had made it to humiliate him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking risks,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;There&#8217;s
legislation on the subject of minors&#8217; debts; Crestwick
began to deal with you before he was twenty-one, and
he&#8217;s still in his trustees&#8217; hands. If he made trouble,
I&#8217;m inclined to think some of your transactions would
look very much like conspiracy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know my man. You people would suffer a good
deal, sooner than advertise yourselves through the law
courts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Crestwick isn&#8217;t one of us,&#8221; Gladwyne objected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, as he aspires to be considered one, he&#8217;ll go
even farther than you would. None are so keen for
the honor of the flock as those who don&#8217;t strictly belong
to the fold. There&#8217;s another point you overlook&mdash;a
person can&#8217;t very well conspire alone, and inquiries
might be made about my confederates. That, however,
is not a matter of much importance, because I
imagine Miss Crestwick would not allow any one to
point to you. Besides, her money&#8217;s safe, and she&#8217;s a
prepossessing young lady.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>Gladwyne straightened himself sharply in his chair.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t go too far! There are things I won&#8217;t stand!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll try to avoid them. All I require is
that you still give the lad the entry of this house and
don&#8217;t interfere with me. You see I&#8217;m reasonable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Gladwyne had interfered, to acquiesce was to
own defeat, which was galling, and while he hesitated
Batley watched him with an air of indulgent amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity you were not quite straight with me at
the beginning, Gladwyne; it would have saved you
trouble,&#8221; he remarked at length. &#8220;I took a sporting
risk at pretty long odds&mdash;I have to do so now and
then and I pay up when I lose. But if I&#8217;d known the
money was to go to Miss Gladwyne and you would only
get the land, I&#8217;d never have kept you supplied; and
in particular I wouldn&#8217;t have made the last big loan
shortly before you and your cousin sailed for Canada.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew it was a blind speculation&mdash;that I ran
the same risk as George did, and that he might outlive
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong on one point,&#8221; Batley objected
dryly. &#8220;I&#8217;m acquainted with your temperament&mdash;it&#8217;s
not one that would lead you into avoidable difficulties.
Well, you came through and your cousin died,
but you failed to pay me off when you came into possession.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve explained that I couldn&#8217;t foresee the trouble
I have in meeting expenses. I&#8217;ve paid you an extortionate
interest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s in arrears,&#8221; retorted Batley. &#8220;You
should have pinched and denied yourself to the utmost
until you had got rid of me. You couldn&#8217;t bring yourself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
to do so&mdash;well, it&#8217;s rather a pity one can&#8217;t have
everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Approaching the table, he quietly took up the lamp.
It was heavy, standing on a massive silver pillar, but
he raised it above his head so that the light streamed
far about the stately room. Then he laughed as he
set it down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something to be the owner of such a place
and enjoy all that it implies&mdash;which includes your
acknowledged status and your neighbors&#8217; respect.
There would be a risk of losing the latter if it came
out that, driven by financial strain, you had been speculating
on your cousin&#8217;s death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne made a little abrupt movement and Batley
saw that his shot had told.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be enough to place you under a cloud,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;People might think that you had at
least not been very reluctant to leave him to starve.
Well, I&#8217;ve had to wait for my money, with the interest
by no means regularly paid, and unless you can square
off the account, I must ask you to leave me a free hand
to deal with Crestwick as I think fit. In return, if
it&#8217;s needful, I&#8217;ll see you through on reasonable terms
until you marry Miss Crestwick or somebody else with
money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On the whole, Gladwyne was conscious of relief.
He had been badly frightened for a moment or two.
If Batley, who had good reasons for distrusting him,
had accepted his account of his cousin&#8217;s death, it was
most unlikely that it had excited suspicion in the mind
of anybody else. Crestwick, however, must be left to
his fate. It was, though he failed to recognize this,
an eventful decision that Gladwyne made.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As you will,&#8221; he answered, rising. &#8220;It&#8217;s late;
I&#8217;m going for my candle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He strode out of the room, and Batley smiled as he
followed him.
</p>
<p>A day or two later Lisle stood on Gladwyne&#8217;s lawn.
Gladwyne entertained freely, and though his neighbors
did not approve of all of his friends, the man had the
gift of pleasing, and his mother unconsciously exerted
a charm on every one. She rarely said anything witty,
but she never said anything unkind and she would
listen with a ready sympathy that sometimes concealed
a lack of comprehension.
</p>
<p>Lisle had a strong respect for the calm, gracious
lady, though she had won it by no more than a smile
or two and a few pleasant words, and he went over to
call upon her every now and then. He was interested
in the company he met at her house; it struck him as
worth studying; and he had a curious feeling that he
was looking on at the preliminary stages of a drama in
which he might presently be called upon to play a leading
part. Besides, he had reasons for watching Gladwyne.
</p>
<p>The stage was an attractive one to a man who had
spent much of his time in the wilderness&mdash;a wide sweep
of sunlit sward with the tennis nets stretched across
part of it; on one side a dark fir wood; and for a
background a stretch of brown moor receding into the
distance, dimmed by an ethereal haze. A group of
young men and women, picturesquely clad, were busy
about the nets; others in flannels and light draperies
strolled here and there across the grass, and a few more
had gathered about the tea-table under a spreading
cedar, where Mrs. Gladwyne sat in a low wicker-chair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Over all there throbbed the low, persistent
murmur of a stream.
</p>
<p>Lisle was talking to Millicent near the table. He
looked up as a burst of laughter rose from beside the
nets and saw Bella Crestwick walk away from them.
One or two of the others stood looking after her, and
Mrs. Gladwyne glanced from her chair inquiringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem amused,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was probably at one of Miss Crestwick&#8217;s remarks;
she&#8217;s undoubtedly original,&#8221; returned Millicent.
&#8220;Still, I think it was chiefly Mr. Marple&#8217;s laugh you
heard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His voice had been most in evidence&mdash;it usually
carried far&mdash;but Lisle was half amused at the disapproval
in the girl&#8217;s tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m now and then a little boisterous,
too,&#8221; he ventured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends a good deal upon what you laugh at,&#8221;
Millicent informed him.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne looked up again, as if she had not
heard, and the girl smiled at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I said isn&#8217;t worth repeating.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She moved away a pace or two and Lisle watched
Bella, who glanced once or twice in his direction as she
crossed the lawn. Somehow he felt that he was wanted
and a little later he strolled after the girl. Millicent
noticed it with a slight frown, though she did not
trouble to ask herself why she was vexed. When Lisle
reached Bella, she regarded him with mischief in her
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As I once mentioned, you learn rapidly,&#8221; she
laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be thankful for the instruction
some day, and I promise not to teach you anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
very detrimental. But I&#8217;m a little surprised that Millicent
Gladwyne allowed you to come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say she could spare me; I&#8217;m not a very entertaining
companion,&#8221; Lisle said humbly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that,&#8221; Bella explained. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
she&#8217;d like you spoiled&mdash;perhaps I should say contaminated;
she has ideas on the subject of education,
too. She always calls me Miss Crestwick, which is
significant; I&#8217;ve no doubt she did so when Marple made
himself conspicuous by his amusement just now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle had noticed the correctness of her assumptions
on other occasions, but he said nothing, for he had
noticed some bitterness in her voice. He walked on
with her and she led him into a path through a shrubbery
bordering the lawn, where she sat down on a
wooden seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said teasingly, &#8220;we have given the
others something to think about; but I&#8217;ve really no
designs on you. It wouldn&#8217;t be much use, anyway.
You&#8217;re safe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked up at him with elfish mischief in her aggressively
pretty face. Dressed in some clinging
fabric of pale watery green that matched the greenish
light in her eyes and the reddish gleam in her hair,
she was very alluring; but it was borne in upon Lisle
that to take up her challenge too boldly would lower
him in the girl&#8217;s regard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m human,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;d better
mention it. But I think it&#8217;s more to the purpose to say
that I&#8217;m altogether at your disposal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I wanted you. As you&#8217;re
almost a stranger, it&#8217;s curious, isn&#8217;t it? But, you see,
I haven&#8217;t a real friend in the world.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if that can be quite correct?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as the people here go, haven&#8217;t you eyes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle had seen the men gather about her, but it was
those he thought least of who followed her most closely,
and the women stood aloof.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are Miss Marple and her mother, anyway;
they&#8217;re friends of yours,&#8221; he pointed out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. Flo and I are in the same class, making
the same fight; but that isn&#8217;t always a reason for mutual
appreciation or support. Mrs. Marple, of course,
is her daughter&#8217;s partizan, though in some ways it
suits us to stand together. But I didn&#8217;t bring you
here to listen to my grievances, but because you happen
to be the one man I can trust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle looked embarrassed, but merely bent his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that silly brother of mine again,&#8221; she went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has he been doing now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what he&#8217;s thinking of doing that&#8217;s the worst.
He has been led to believe it&#8217;s easy to acquire riches
on the stock exchange and that he has the makings of
a successful speculator in him. Cards and the turf
I&#8217;ve had to tolerate&mdash;after all, there were ways in
which he got some return for what he spent on them&mdash;but
this last craze may be disastrous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he get the idea that he&#8217;s a financial
genius? It wouldn&#8217;t be from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said seriously; &#8220;I&#8217;m his sister and most
unlikely to encourage him in such delusions. I don&#8217;t
think Batley had much trouble in putting the notion
into his mind.&#8221; Her expression suddenly changed.
&#8220;How I hate that man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle looked down at her with grave sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite easy to get into difficulties by speculating,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
unless one has ample means. But I understood&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella checked him with a gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim comes into money&mdash;we have a good allowance
now&mdash;but it will be nearly two years before he
gets possession. I want him to start fair when he
may, perhaps, have learned a little sense, and not to
find himself burdened with debts and associates he
can&#8217;t get rid of. At present, Batley&#8217;s lending him
money at exorbitant interest. I&#8217;ve pleaded, I&#8217;ve
stormed and told him plain truths; but it isn&#8217;t the
least use.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Why don&#8217;t you take him away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t come. It would be worse if I left him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know why Gladwyne tolerates Batley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221; Bella looked up sharply. &#8220;What has
that to do with it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle thought it had a bearing on the matter, as the
lad would have seen less of Batley without Gladwyne&#8217;s
connivance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he countered, &#8220;what would you like me to
do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to answer. He&#8217;s obstinate and resents
advice. You might, however, talk to him when
you have a chance; he&#8217;s beginning to have a respect
for your opinions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s gratifying,&#8221; Lisle commented dryly.
&#8220;He was inclined to patronize me at first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She spread out her hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too big to mind it! Tell him anything
you can about disastrous mining ventures; but don&#8217;t
begin as if you meant to warn him&mdash;lead up to the
subject casually.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m not very tactful,&#8221; Lisle confessed.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll see what I&#8217;m after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not very likely. Talk as if you considered
him a man of experience. It&#8217;s fortunate that you can
be of help in this case, because I think some Canadian
mining shares are to be the latest deal. From what
Jim said it looks as if Batley was to give him some information
about them on Wednesday, when Gladwyne
and he are expected at Marple&#8217;s. Can&#8217;t you come?
I understand you have been asked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; promised Lisle. &#8220;If I have an opportunity,
I&#8217;ll see what can be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella rose and smiled at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go back; I&#8217;m comforted already. You&#8217;re
not profuse, but one feels that you will keep a
promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked across the lawn, Bella now conversing
in an animated strain about unimportant matters,
though it did not occur to Lisle that this was for the
benefit of the lookers-on. On approaching the tea-table,
she adroitly secured possession of a chair which
another lady who stood higher in her hostess&#8217;s esteem
was making for, and sitting down chatted cheerfully
with Mrs. Gladwyne. Lisle was conscious of some
amusement as he watched her. She was clever and
her courage appealed to him; but presently he saw
Millicent and strolled toward where she was standing.
She spoke to him, but he thought she was not quite so
gracious as she had been before he went away.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>LISLE COMES TO THE RESCUE</h3>
</div>

<p>A few days after his interview with Bella, Lisle
overtook Millicent as she was walking up a
wooded dale. She looked around with a smile
when he joined her and they fell into friendly talk.
There were points on which they differed, but a sense
of mutual appreciation was steadily growing stronger
between them. Presently Lisle happened to mention
the Marples, and Millicent glanced at him thoughtfully.
She knew that he met Bella at their house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen a good deal of these people, one
way or another,&#8221; she remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These people? Aren&#8217;t you a little prejudiced
against them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I am,&#8221; Millicent confessed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then won&#8217;t you give me the reason? Your point
of view isn&#8217;t always clear to an outsider.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to be lucid. I don&#8217;t so much object to
Marple as I do to what he stands for; I mean to modern
tendency.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as involved as ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl showed a little good-humored impatience.
She did not care to supply the explanation&mdash;it was
against her instincts&mdash;and she was inclined to wonder
why she should do so merely because the man had
asked for it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the feudal system isn&#8217;t dead,
and I believe that what is best in it need never disappear
altogether. Of course, it had its drawbacks,
but I think it was better than the commercialism that
is replacing it. It recognized obligations on both
sides, and there is a danger of forgetting them; the
new people often fail to realize them at all. Marple&mdash;I&#8217;m
using him as an example&mdash;bought the land for
what he could get out of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About three per cent., he told me. It isn&#8217;t a
great inducement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent made a half-disdainful gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He gets a great deal more&mdash;sport, a status,
friends and standing, and a means of suitably entertaining
them. That, I suppose, is one reason why the
return in money from purely agricultural land is so
small.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then is it wrong for a business man to buy these
things, if he can pay for them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! But he must take up the duties attached
to his purchase. When you buy land, human lives
go with it. They&#8217;re still largely in the landlord&#8217;s
hands. Of course, we have legislation which has curtailed
the land-owner&#8217;s former powers, but it&#8217;s a soulless,
mechanical thing that can never really take the
place of direct personal interest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stopped and glanced back down the winding
dale. Here and there smooth pastures climbed the
slopes that shut it in, but over part of them ranged
mighty oaks, still almost green. Beyond these, beeches
tinted with brown and crimson glowed against the
dusky foliage of spruces and silver-firs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One needs wisdom, love of the soil and all that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
lives on it, and perhaps patience most of all,&#8221; she resumed.
&#8220;These woods are an example. They are not
natural like your forests&mdash;every tree has been carefully
planted and as it grew the young sheltering
wood about it carefully thinned out. Then as the
trunks gained in size it was necessary to choose with
care and cut. With the oaks it&#8217;s a work of generations,
planting for one&#8217;s great-grandchildren, and the
point that is suggested most clearly is the continuity
of interest that should exist between the men who use
the spade and ax and the men who own and plan.
It is not a little thing that the third and fourth generations
should complete the task, when a mutual toleration
and dependence is handed down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle was conscious of a curious stirring of his
feelings as he listened to her. She was tall and finely
proportioned, endowed with a calm and gracious dignity
which was nevertheless, he thought, in keeping
with a sanguine and virile nature. This girl was one
of the fairest and most precious products of the soil
she loved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity in many ways that the Gladwyne property
didn&#8217;t come to you,&#8221; he observed.
</p>
<p>Her expression changed and he spread out one hand
deprecatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another blunder of mine. I haven&#8217;t acquired
your people&#8217;s unfailing caution yet, but I only
meant&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it would be better if you didn&#8217;t tell me
what you did mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle nodded. He felt that he had deserved the rebuke,
as the truth of his assertion could not be admitted
without disparaging Gladwyne. She would allow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
nothing to the latter&#8217;s discredit to be said by a
stranger, but it was unpleasant to think that she regarded
him as one. He changed the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mentioned that landlord and laborer had a
joint interest in the soil, and that&#8217;s undoubtedly
right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The point where trouble arises is,
of course, over the division of the yield. The former&#8217;s
share is obvious, but nowadays plowman and forester
want more than their fathers seem to have been satisfied
with. I don&#8217;t think you can blame them&mdash;in Canada
they get more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you an instance to show why one can&#8217;t
treat them very liberally. When my brother got possession
he spent a great deal of money&mdash;it was left
him by his mother and didn&#8217;t come out of the land&mdash;in
draining, improvements, and rebuilding homesteads
and cottages, besides freely giving his time and care.
For a number of years he got no return at all, and
part of the expenditure will always be unproductive.
It isn&#8217;t a solitary case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went on together through the shadowy, crimson-tinted
dale until Millicent stopped at the gate of a
field-road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to one of the cottages yonder,&#8221; she
explained. &#8220;I expect Nasmyth on Wednesday evening.
Are you coming with him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m going to Marple&#8217;s. You see,
I promised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Promised Marple?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was learning to understand her, for though she
showed no marked sign of displeasure he knew that
she was not gratified.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;Miss Crestwick.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>She did not speak, but there was something in her
manner that hinted at disdainful amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re hardly fair to her,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible,&#8221; Millicent replied carelessly. &#8220;Does
it matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he broke out with some warmth, &#8220;the girl
hasn&#8217;t such an easy time among you; and one can only
respect her for the way she stands by her brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you anything to say in his favor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be pretty difficult,&#8221; admitted Lisle.
&#8220;But you can&#8217;t blame his sister for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve shown any desire to do so,&#8221; she
retorted.
</p>
<p>Lisle knit his brows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You people are rather curious in your ideas.
Now, here&#8217;s a lonely girl who&#8217;s pluckily trying to look
after that senseless lad, and not a one of you can
spare her a word of sympathy, because she doesn&#8217;t run
on the same stereotyped lines as you do. Can you
help only the people who will conform?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent let this pass, and after an indifferent word
or two she turned away. Before she reached home,
however, she met Nasmyth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you keep Mr. Lisle out of those Marples&#8217;
hands?&#8221; she asked him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, I&#8217;m not sure that I could do so;
in the second, I don&#8217;t see why I should try,&#8221; Nasmyth
replied. &#8220;On the whole, considering that he&#8217;s a
Western miner, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s running a serious
risk. Perhaps I might hint that Bella Crestwick&#8217;s
hardly likely to consider him as big enough game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be coarse!&#8221; Millicent paused. &#8220;But he
spoke hotly in her defense.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; responded Nasmyth, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder
if she deserves it; but it has no significance. You
see, he&#8217;s a rather chivalrous person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent flashed a quick glance at him, but his face
was expressionless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember exactly: he hinted that we were
narrow-minded and uncharitable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I almost think there&#8217;s some truth in it. I&#8217;ve seen
you a little severe on those outside the fold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s charity is apt to be influenced by a pretty
face,&#8221; Millicent retorted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit it,&#8221; replied Nasmyth dryly. &#8220;But I
can&#8217;t undertake to determine how far that fact has
any bearing on this particular instance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent talked about something else, but she was
annoyed with herself when the question Nasmyth had
raised once more obtruded itself on her attention during
the evening.
</p>
<p>On Wednesday Lisle walked over to Marple&#8217;s house,
because he had promised to go, though he would much
rather have spent an hour or two with Nasmyth and
Millicent in the latter&#8217;s drawing-room. He had no
opportunity for any private speech with Bella, but
she flung him a grateful glance as he came in. He
waited patiently and followed her brother here and
there, but he could not secure a word with him alone.
</p>
<p>Some time had passed when, escaping from a group
engaged in what struck him as particularly stupid
badinage, he sauntered toward the billiard-room, struggling
with a feeling of irritation. He was generally
good-humored and tolerant rather than hypercritical,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
but the somewhat senseless hilarity of Marple&#8217;s guests
was beginning to jar on him. A burst of laughter
which he thought had been provoked by one of Bella&#8217;s
sallies followed him down the corridor, but when he
quietly opened the door the billiard-room was empty
except for a group of three in one corner. He stopped
just inside the threshold, glancing at them, and it
was evident that they had not heard his approach.
</p>
<p>Wreaths of cigar smoke drifted about the room;
the light of the shaded lamps fell upon the men seated
on a lounge, and their expressions and attitudes were
significant. Gladwyne leaned back languidly graceful;
Batley, a burlier figure, was talking, his eyes fixed
on Crestwick; and the lad sat upright, looking eager.
Batley appeared to be discussing the principles of
operating on the stock exchange.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that there&#8217;s very little to
be made by waiting until any particular stock becomes
a popular favorite&mdash;the premium equalizes the profit
and sometimes does away with it. The essential thing
is to take hold at the beginning, when the shares are
more or less in disfavor and can be picked up cheap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle stood still&mdash;he was in the shadow&mdash;watching
the lad, who now showed signs of uncertainty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dropped a good deal of money the last time I
tried it,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;The trouble is that if you
come in when the company&#8217;s starting, you can&#8217;t form
an accurate idea of how it ought to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; replied Batley. &#8220;You can rarely be
quite sure. What you need is sound judgment, the
sense to recognize a good thing when you see it,
pluck, and the sporting instinct&mdash;you must be ready
to back your opinion and take a risk. It&#8217;s only the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
necessity for that kind of thing which makes it a fine
game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off, looking up, and as Lisle strolled forward
with a glance at Crestwick, he saw Batley&#8217;s
genial expression change. It was evident that the
idea of being credited with the qualities mentioned appealed
to the lad, and Lisle realized that Batley was
wishing him far away. He had, however, no intention
of withdrawing, and taking out a cigar he chose
a cue and awkwardly proceeded to practise a shot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said nonchalantly, &#8220;is an amusement I
never had time to learn, and I really came along for a
quiet smoke. Don&#8217;t let me disturb you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw Crestwick&#8217;s look and understood what was
in the lad&#8217;s mind. It was incomprehensible to the
latter that a man should boldly confess his ignorance
of a game of high repute. Batley, however, seeing
that the intruder intended to remain, returned to the
attack, and though he spoke in a lower voice Lisle
caught part of his remarks and decided that he was
cleverly playing upon Crestwick&#8217;s raw belief in himself.
This roused the Canadian to indignation,
though it was directed against Gladwyne rather than
his companion. Batley, he thought, was to some
extent an adventurer, one engaged in a hazardous
business at which he could not always win, and he had
some desirable qualities&mdash;good-humor, liberality,
coolness and daring. The well-bred gentleman who
served as his decoy, however, possessed none of these
redeeming characteristics. His part was merely despicable;
there was only meanness beneath his polished
exterior.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly looks promising,&#8221; Lisle heard Crestwick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
say; &#8220;you have pretty well convinced me that
it can&#8217;t go wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see any serious risk,&#8221; declared Batley.
&#8220;That, in the case of mining stock, is as far as I&#8217;d
care to go. On the other hand, there&#8217;s every prospect
of a surprising change in the value of the shares as
soon as the results of the first reduction of ore come
out. I can only add that I&#8217;m a holder and I got you
the offer of the shares as a favor from a friend who&#8217;s
behind the scenes. Don&#8217;t take them unless you feel
inclined.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was a slip, as Lisle recognized. It is not in
human nature to dispose of a commodity that will
shortly increase in value. Crestwick, however, obviously
failed to notice this; Lisle thought the idea of
getting on to the inside track appealed to his vanity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a curious name they&#8217;ve given the mine,&#8221; commented
the lad, repeating it. &#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle started, for he recognized the name, and it
offered him a lead. Strolling toward the group, he
leaned against the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell you that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an Indian
word for a river gorge. I went up it not long ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; exclaimed Crestwick, &#8220;I suppose you
know the mine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle glanced at the others. Their eyes were fixed
upon him, Batley&#8217;s steadily, Gladwyne&#8217;s with a hint
of uneasiness. It was, he felt, a remarkable piece of
good fortune that had given him control of the situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered carelessly, &#8220;I know the mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of taking shares in it,&#8221; Crestwick informed
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Lisle, &#8220;that wouldn&#8217;t be wise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne leaned farther back in his seat, as if to
disassociate himself from the discussion, which was
what the Canadian had expected from him; but Batley,
who was of more resolute fiber, showed fight. His
appearance became aggressive, his face hardened, and
there was a snap in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have made a serious allegation in a rather
startling way, Mr. Lisle. As I&#8217;ve an interest in the
company in question, I must ask you to explain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;d advise you to get rid of your interest
as soon as possible; that is, so long as you don&#8217;t sell
out to Crestwick, who&#8217;s a friend of mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Batley&#8217;s face began to redden, and Lisle, looking
around at the sound of a footstep, saw Marple standing
a pace or two away. He was a fussy, bustling
man, and he raised his hand in expostulation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that last called for, or quite the thing,
Lisle?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Batley turned to Gladwyne, as if for support, and
the latter assumed his finest air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there can be only one opinion on that
point,&#8221; he declared.
</p>
<p>Lisle&#8217;s eyes gleamed with an amusement that was
stronger than his indignation. That Gladwyne
should expect this gravely delivered decision to have
any marked effect tickled him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to stand by what
I said, and I&#8217;ll add that if I had any shares I&#8217;d give
them away to anybody who would register as their
owner before the next call is made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understood there wouldn&#8217;t be a call for a long
while,&#8221; Crestwick broke in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then whoever told you so must have been misinformed,&#8221;
Lisle rejoined.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you casting any doubt upon my honor?&#8221;
Batley demanded in a bellicose voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so; anyway, so long as you don&#8217;t
rule out my suggestion. Still, I&#8217;m willing to leave
Gladwyne to decide the point. He seems to understand
these delicate matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Marple, looking distressed and irresolute, broke in
before Gladwyne had a chance to reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know much about mining, Lisle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had opportunities for learning something, as
prospector, locator of alluvial claims and holder of an
interest in one or two comparatively prosperous companies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He leaned forward and touched Crestwick&#8217;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Jim, and I&#8217;ll give you one or two particulars
that should decide you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somewhat to his astonishment, the lad rose and
rather sheepishly followed him. There was an awkward
silence for a few moments after they left the
room; then Marple turned to his guests.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t undertake to say whether Lisle was justified
or not,&#8221; he began. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, however, that
anything of this nature should have happened in my
house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Gladwyne with gracious condescension.
&#8220;There is, of course, one obvious remedy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Marple raised his hands in expostulation. He liked
Lisle, and Gladwyne was a distinguished guest. Batley
seemed to find his confusion amusing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the only thing we can do is to let the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
matter drop,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;These fellows from the
wilds are primitive&mdash;one can&#8217;t expect too much. The
correct feeling or delicacy of expression we&#8217;d look for
among ourselves is hardly in their line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Marple was mollified, and he fell in with Batley&#8217;s
suggestion that they should try a game.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Crestwick looked around at his
companion as they went down the corridor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I owe you some thanks,&#8221; he admitted.
&#8220;I like the way you headed off Batley&mdash;I think he
meant to turn savage at first&mdash;and I wouldn&#8217;t have
been willing to draw in Gladwyne, as you did. He has
a way of crushing you with a look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s merely a sign that you deserve it,&#8221; Lisle
laughed. &#8220;You take too many things for granted in
this country. Test another man&#8217;s assumption of
superiority before you agree with it, and you&#8217;ll sometimes
be astonished to find out what it&#8217;s really founded
on. And now we&#8217;d better join those people who&#8217;re
singing.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>BELLA&#8217;S DEFEAT</h3>
</div>

<p>The afternoon was calm and hazy, and Lisle
lounged with great content in a basket-chair
on Millicent&#8217;s lawn. His hostess sat near by,
looking listless, a somewhat unusual thing for her,
and Miss Hume, her elderly companion, genial in spite
of her precise formality, was industriously embroidering
something not far away. There was not a
breath of wind astir; a soft gray sky streaked with
long bars of stronger color hung motionless over the
wide prospect. Wood and moorland ridge and distant
hill had faded to dimness of contour and quiet neutral
tones. Indeed, the whole scene seemed steeped in a profound
tranquillity, intensified only by the murmur of
the river.
</p>
<p>Lisle enjoyed it all, though he was conscious that
Millicent&#8217;s presence added to its charm. He had
grown to feel restful and curiously at ease in her
company. She was, he thought, so essentially natural;
one felt at home with her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t often seen you with the unoccupied appearance
you have just now,&#8221; he remarked at length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have sent the book off, and after being at work
on it so long, I feel disinclined to do anything else,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just heard from the publishers; they
don&#8217;t seem enthusiastic. After all, one couldn&#8217;t expect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
that&mdash;the style of the thing is rather out of the
usual course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle looked angry and she was pleased with his indignation
on her behalf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They show precious little sense!&#8221; he declared;
&#8220;but you&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s one of your English customs
to go on from precedent to precedent until you get
an unmodifiable standard, when you slavishly conform
to it. Now your book&#8217;s neither a classification nor
a catalogue&mdash;it&#8217;s something far bigger. Never
mind what the experts and scientists say; wait until
the people who love the wild things and want their
story made real get it into their hands!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His confidence was gratifying, but she changed the
subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You Canadians haven&#8217;t much respect for precedent?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; we try to meet the varying need by constantly
changing means. They&#8217;re often crude, but
they&#8217;re successful, as a rule.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a system that must have a wide effect,&#8221; she
responded, to lead him on. She liked to hear him talk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has. You can see it in the difference between
your country and mine. This land&#8217;s smooth and well
trimmed; everything in it has grown up little by little;
its mellow ripeness is its charm. Ours is grand or
rugged or desolate, but it&#8217;s never merely pretty. The
same applies to our people; they&#8217;re bubbling over with
raw, optimistic vigor, their corners are not rubbed
off. Some of them would jar on overcivilized people,
but not, I think, on any one with understanding.&#8221; He
spread out his hands. &#8220;You have an example; I&#8217;m
spouting at large again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; she begged; &#8220;I&#8217;m interested. But have
you ever thought that instead of being younger than
we are you&#8217;re really older. I mean that you have gone
back a long way; begun again at an earlier stage,
instead of going ahead?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you get at the bottom of things!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;That&#8217;s always been an idea of mine. The
people of the newer countries, perhaps more particularly
those to whom I belong, are brought back to
the grapple with elemental conditions. We&#8217;re on the
bed-rock of nature.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you too modest to go any further?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He showed faint signs of confusion and she laughed.
&#8220;No doubt, the situation makes for pristine vigor,
and we are drifting into artificiality,&#8221; she suggested.
&#8220;Perhaps you, the toilers, the subduers of the wilderness,
are to serve as an anchor for the supercivilized
generations to hold on by.&#8221; She paused and quoted
softly: &#8220;&#8216;Pioneers; O pioneers!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I say to that?&#8221; he asked with half-amused
embarrassment. &#8220;We&#8217;re pretty egotistical,
but one can&#8217;t go back on Whitman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she laughed mischievously; &#8220;I think you&#8217;re
loyal; and there are situations from which it&#8217;s difficult
to extricate oneself. Didn&#8217;t you find it so, for example,
when you declined to come here with Nasmyth,
because Miss Crestwick had pressed you to go to
Marple&#8217;s?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He could think of no neat reply to this and the
obvious fact pleased her, for she guessed that he
would rather have spent the evening with her. This
was true, for now, sitting in the quiet garden in her
company, he looked back on the entertainment with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
something like disgust. Marple&#8217;s male friends were,
for the most part, characterized by a certain grossness
and sensuality; in their amusements at games of
chance one or two had displayed an open avarice.
These things jarred on the man who had toiled among
the rocks and woods, where he had practised a stringent
self-denial.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that you figured in a striking little
scene,&#8221; Millicent went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it.&#8221; Lisle appeared annoyed.
&#8220;That man Batley irritated me; though, after all, I
don&#8217;t blame him the most.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was a slip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom do you blame?&#8221; she asked sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t the only person,
present, and I hadn&#8217;t arrived at the beginning. Somebody
should have stopped the fellow; the shares he
tried to work off on Crestwick were no good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Batley wanted to sell that silly lad some
worthless shares&mdash;and there were other people looking
on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He would not tell her that Gladwyne had watched
the proceedings, to some extent acquiescing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought from what you said that you knew all
about it,&#8221; he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied, suspecting the truth, but seeing
that it would be difficult to extract anything definite
from him. &#8220;I only heard that you had an encounter
of some kind with Batley. But why did you hint that
he was not the worst?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was merely acting in accordance with his instincts;
one wouldn&#8217;t expect anything else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The implication is that he was tacitly abetted by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
people of a different kind who ought to have known
better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was not to be drawn on this point, and she respected
him for it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it only an animus against Batley that
prompted you?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he admitted candidly; &#8220;I wanted to get
young Crestwick out of his clutches. I&#8217;m not sure
he&#8217;s worth troubling about, but I&#8217;m sorry for his sister.
As I&#8217;ve said before, there&#8217;s something fine in the way
she sticks to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The chivalrous feeling did him credit, Millicent admitted,
but she was dissatisfied with it and was curious
to learn if it were the only one he cherished toward
the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s undoubtedly in her favor,&#8221; she commented
indifferently.
</p>
<p>He did not respond and they talked about other
matters; but Lisle was now sensible of a slight constraint
in Millicent&#8217;s manner and on the whole she
was glad when he took his leave. Quick-witted, as
she was, she guessed that he disapproved of the part
Clarence had played in the affair at Marple&#8217;s, and
this, chiming with her own suspicions, troubled her.
She had a tenderness for Clarence, and she wondered
how far her influence might restrain and protect him
if, as his mother had suggested, she eventually married
him. Another point caused her some uneasiness&mdash;Bella
Crestwick had boldly entered the field against
her and was making use of the Canadian to rouse
Clarence by showing him that he had a rival. The
thought of it stirred her to indignation; she would
not have Lisle treated in that fashion. After sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
still for half an hour, she rose with a gesture of impatience
and went into the house.
</p>
<p>On the same evening Bella Crestwick felt impelled
to lecture her brother after dinner. That was not
a favorable time, for the young man&#8217;s good opinion
of himself was generally strengthened by a glass or
two of wine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that matter of the shares would have
taught you sense, but you must listen to Batley again
this afternoon,&#8221; she scolded. &#8220;You were with him
for half an hour. I&#8217;ve no patience with you,
Jim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not so easy to shake off, particularly as I&#8217;m
in his debt,&#8221; returned the lad. &#8220;Besides, he&#8217;s an interesting
fellow, the kind you learn a good deal from.
It&#8217;s an education to mix with such men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that it&#8217;s expensive. Come away
with me before he ruins you. There&#8217;s Mrs. Barnard&#8217;s
invitation to their place in Scotland; it would be a
good excuse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her brother&#8217;s rather lofty manner changed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a dear, Bella. You know you don&#8217;t want
to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Having a strong reason for wishing to stay, she
colored at this. Among his other unprepossessing
characteristics, Jim had a trick of saying things he
should suppress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind me,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Will you
come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had an incomplete recognition of the magnitude
of the sacrifice she was ready to make, though it was
not this that decided him not to fall in with it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said with raw self-confidence. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
one to run away; but I&#8217;ll promise to keep my eye on
the fellow after this and be cautious. All his schemes
aren&#8217;t in the same class as those mining shares, you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella lost her temper and told him some plain
truths about himself, and this did not improve matters,
for in the end she retired, defeated, leaving Jim
rather sore but on the whole satisfied with the firmness
he had displayed. The girl felt dejected and
almost desperate. She could not continually apply to
Lisle for assistance, and she shrank from the only
other course that seemed open to her; but her affection
for the misguided lad impelled her to make another
attempt to rescue him, and a few days later
she found her opportunity. It was a bold measure
she had decided on, one that might cost her a good
deal, but she was a young woman of courage and determination.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Marple and her daughter drove over with her
to call on Mrs. Gladwyne. They found several other
people present, and as usual there was no ceremony; the
day was fine, and the hostess sat outside, while the
guests strolled about the terrace and gardens very
much as they liked. Bella, hearing that Clarence was
engaged in the library and would not be down for
a little while, slipped away in search of him. Her
heart beat painfully fast as she went up the wide
staircase, but she was outwardly very collected&mdash;a
slender, attractive figure&mdash;when she entered the
room. In her dress as well as in her manner Bella
was usually distinguished by something unconventional
and picturesque. She was not pleased to see
Batley standing beside the table at which Gladwyne
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
sat, but the man gathered up some papers when he
noticed her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve explained the thing, Gladwyne, and I expect
Miss Crestwick will excuse me,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>His manner was good-humored as he bowed to her
and though she almost hated the man she was conscious
of a faint respect for him. He might have
thwarted her by remaining, for she had often made
him a butt for her bitter wit. Now, however, when
she had shown that his presence was not required, he
was gallantly withdrawing. When he went out she
sat down and Gladwyne rose and stood with one hand
on the mantel, waiting for her to begin. Instead, she
glanced round the room, which always impressed her.
It was lofty and spacious, the few articles of massive
furniture gave it a severe dignity, and there was no
doubt that Gladwyne, with his handsome person and
highbred air, appeared at home in it.
</p>
<p>While she looked around, he was thinking about
her. She was provocatively pretty; a fearless, passionate
creature, addicted to occasional reckless outbreaks,
but nevertheless endowed with a vein of cold
and calculating sense. What was as much to the
point, she was wealthy, and people were becoming
more tolerant toward her; but in the meanwhile he
wondered what she wanted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came about Jim,&#8221; she said at length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s expression, which suddenly changed, was
not encouraging and she hesitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what he&#8217;s doing. I&#8217;ve come to ask a
favor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He avoided the issue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing alarming; I don&#8217;t suppose he&#8217;s very
different from most lads of his age. Perhaps it would
be better to let him have his head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied decidedly. &#8220;The pace is too
hot; I can&#8217;t hold him. He&#8217;ll come to grief badly if
he&#8217;s not pulled up. You know that as well as I do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her anger became her, bringing a fine glow to her
cheeks and a hint of half-imperious dignity into her
pose. It had an effect on him, but he felt somewhat
ashamed of himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he asked in a quiet voice, &#8220;what&#8217;s the
favor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t a sportsman and a man of your kind
grant it unconditionally beforehand? Must you be
sure you won&#8217;t get hurt when you make a venture?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d risk it,&#8221; he answered, bowing. &#8220;You&#8217;re
admirable, Bella. Still, you see, I&#8217;m either more
cautious or less courageous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was badly disappointed. She knew that a good
deal depended on his answer to her request, and shrank
from making it, because it would prove the strength
or weakness of her hold on him. The man attracted
her, and she had somewhat openly attempted to capture
him. She longed for the position he could give
her; she would have married him for that and his
house, but she was willing to risk her success for her
brother&#8217;s welfare.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to tell Batley that he must keep his
hands off of Jim,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>He started at this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t do the lad much harm. Aren&#8217;t you attaching
a little too much importance to the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; not in the least,&#8221; she answered vehemently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you so already. But can&#8217;t you keep to the
point? My brother&#8217;s being ruined in several ways
besides the debts he&#8217;s heaping up; and I&#8217;ve humbled
myself to beg your help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it so very hard?&#8221; he asked, and his voice
grew soft and caressing.
</p>
<p>She was shaken to the verge of yielding. The man
was handsome, cultivated, distinguished, she thought.
Whether she actually loved him, she did not know,
but he could gratify her ambitions and she was
strongly drawn to him. He had given her a lead, an
opening for a few telling words that might go far
toward the accomplishment of her wishes; but,
tempted as she was, she would not utter them. She
was loyal to the headstrong lad; Jim stood first with
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is beside the point,&#8221; she said with a becoming
air of pride. &#8220;I expected you would be willing
to do whatever you could. To be refused what I
plead for is new to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He considered for a moment or two, watching her
with keen appreciation. Bella in her present mood,
with her affectations cast aside, appealed to him. She
was not altogether the woman he would have chosen,
but since he must secure a rich wife, there were obvious
benefits to be derived from a match with her.
He devoutly wished he could accede to her request.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she broke out impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;m unable to do as you
desire. Of course, I wish I could, if only to please
you, though I really don&#8217;t think the thing&#8217;s necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell me that again! It&#8217;s a waste of
time; I&#8217;m not going to discuss it. Face the difficulty,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
whatever it is. Do you mean that you can&#8217;t warn
off Batley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne saw that she would insist on a definite
answer and in desperation he told the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s out of the question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a shock to her. In a sudden flash of illumination
she saw him as he was, weak and irresolute,
helpless in the grip of a stronger man. It was significant
that she felt no compassion for him, but only
disgust and contempt. She was no coward, and even
Jim, who could so easily be deluded, was ready enough
to fight on due occasion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are afraid of the fellow!&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>Gladwyne colored and moved abruptly. He had
imagined that she was his for the asking, but there
was no mistaking her cutting scorn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bella,&#8221; he pleaded, &#8220;don&#8217;t be bitter. You can&#8217;t
understand the difficulties I&#8217;m confronted with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can understand too much!&#8221; Her voice
trembled, but she rose, rather white in face, with an
air of decision. &#8220;When I came I expected&mdash;but
after all that doesn&#8217;t matter&mdash;I never expected
this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made no answer; the man had some little pride
and there was nothing to be said. He had fallen very
low even in this girl&#8217;s estimation and the fact was almost
intolerably galling, but he could make no effective
defense. She went from him slowly, but with a suggestive
deliberation, without looking back, and there
was a hint of finality in the way she closed the door.
</p>
<p>Once outside, she strove to brace herself, for the interview
had tried her hard. She had had to choose
between Gladwyne and her brother, but for that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
was now almost thankful. The man she had admired
had changed and become contemptible. It was as if
he had suddenly collapsed and shriveled before her
startled eyes. But that was not all the trouble&mdash;she
was as far from saving Jim as ever.
</p>
<p>It cost her an effort to rejoin the others, but she
was equal to it and during the rest of her stay her
conversation was a shade more audacious than usual.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>GLADWYNE SURRENDERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Evening was drawing on when Bella strolled
aimlessly down the ascending road that led to
Marple&#8217;s residence. On one hand of the road
there was a deep rift, filled with shadow, in which a
beck murmured among the stones, and the oaks that
climbed to the ridge above flung their great branches
against the saffron glow in the western sky. Fallen
leaves, glowing brown and red, had gathered thick
beneath one hedgerow and more came slowly sailing
down; but Bella brushed through them unheeding, oblivious
to her surroundings. She had suffered during
the few days that had followed her interview with
Gladwyne and even the sharp encounter with Miss
Marple in which she had recently indulged had not
cheered her, though it had left her friend smarting.
</p>
<p>Presently she looked around with interest as a
figure appeared farther up the road, and recognizing
the fine poise and vigorous stride, she stopped and
waited. Lisle was a bracing person to talk to, and
she wanted to see him. He soon came up with her
and she greeted him cordially. Unlike Gladwyne, he
was a real man, resolute and resourceful, with a generous
vein in him, and she did not resent the fact that
he looked rather hard at her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem as cheerful as usual,&#8221; he observed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;In fact, I think I was
very nearly crying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; He showed both interest
and sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you needn&#8217;t ask. It&#8217;s Jim again. I&#8217;ve tried
every means and I can&#8217;t do anything with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is pretty uncontrollable. Seems to have gone
back to Batley again. I wonder if it would be any
good if I looked for an opportunity for making a row
with the fellow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, with appreciation, for this was
very different from Gladwyne&#8217;s attitude. &#8220;It would
only separate Jim from you, and I don&#8217;t want that
to happen. Please keep hold of him, though I know
that can&#8217;t be pleasant for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is trying now and then, but I&#8217;ll do what I
can. Gladwyne, however, has more influence than I
have. Did you think of asking him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She colored, and in her brief confusion he read
his answer with strong indignation&mdash;she had pleaded
with Gladwyne and he had refused to help.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; she said, looking up at him,
&#8220;you&#8217;re the only real friend I have. There&#8217;s nobody
else I can trust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re wrong in that,&#8221; he declared; and
acting on impulse he laid a hand protectingly on her
shoulder, for she looked very dejected and forlorn.
&#8220;Anyway, you mustn&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll do something&mdash;in
fact, something will have to be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He knitted his brows. There was a course, which
promised to be effective, open to him, but he was most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
averse to adopting it. He could give Gladwyne a
plain hint that he had better restrain his confederate,
but he could enforce compliance only by stating what
he knew about the former&#8217;s desertion of his cousin.
He was not ready to do that yet; it would precipitate
the climax, and once his knowledge of the matter was
revealed his power to use it in case of a stronger
need might be diminished. The temptation to leave
Jim Crestwick to his fate was strong, but his pity
for the anxious girl was stronger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a talk with Gladwyne,&#8221; he promised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be of the least use!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;ll do what I suggest,&#8221; Lisle answered
with a trace of grimness. &#8220;Make your mind easy;
I&#8217;ll have Batley stopped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked at him in surprise, filled with relief and
gratitude. He was one who would not promise more
than he could perform; but how he could force his
will on Gladwyne she did not know.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wonderful!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Whatever
one asks you&#8217;re able to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re very staunch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, standing very close to him, with
his hand still on her shoulder, &#8220;we won&#8217;t exchange
compliments&mdash;they&#8217;re too empty, and you deserve
something better.&#8221; She glanced round swiftly.
&#8220;Shut your eyes, tight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He obeyed her, and for a moment light fingers rested
on his breast; then there was a faint warm touch upon
his cheek. When he looked up she was standing a
yard away, smiling mockingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trust your imagination too much&mdash;it
might have deceived you,&#8221; she warned. &#8220;But you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
have sense; you wouldn&#8217;t attach an undue value to
anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Confidence and gratitude are precious,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;I&#8217;d better point out that I haven&#8217;t earned
either of them yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella was satisfied with this, but she grew graver,
wondering how far she might have delivered Gladwyne
into his hands. She was angry with the man, but
she would not have him suffer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what power you have&mdash;but you
won&#8217;t make too much use of it&mdash;I don&#8217;t wish that,&#8221;
she begged. &#8220;After all, though, Jim must be got
out of that fellow&#8217;s clutches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Lisle, &#8220;there&#8217;s no doubt of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She left him presently and he went on down the dale,
not exactly repenting of his promise, but regretting
the necessity which had led to his making it. The
task with which he had saddled himself was an exceedingly
unpleasant one and might afterward make
it more difficult for him to accomplish the purpose
that had brought him to England, but he meant to
carry it out.
</p>
<p>As it happened, he met Mrs. Gladwyne at Millicent&#8217;s,
where he called, and he spent an uncomfortable
half-hour in her company. She had shown in various
ways that she liked him, and calling him to her side
soon after he came in, she talked to him in an unusually
genial manner. He felt like a traitor in this
gracious lady&#8217;s presence and it was a relief when she
took her departure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look troubled,&#8221; Millicent observed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I feel,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;After all, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
isn&#8217;t a very uncommon sensation. It&#8217;s sometimes difficult
to see ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Often,&#8221; she answered, smiling. &#8220;What do you
do then&mdash;stop a little and consider?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as a rule. The longer you consider the difficulties,
the worse they look. It&#8217;s generally better to
go right on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent agreed with this; and soon afterward Lisle
took his departure and walked back to Nasmyth&#8217;s in
an unusually serious mood. They were sitting smoking
when his host broached the subject that was occupying
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some time since you said anything about the
project that brought you over,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; assented Lisle. &#8220;I&#8217;m fixed much as
I was when we last spoke of it. When I was in
Canada, I thought I&#8217;d only to find Gladwyne and
scare a confession out of him. Now I find that what
I&#8217;ve undertaken isn&#8217;t by any means so simple.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I warned you that it wouldn&#8217;t be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were right. There&#8217;s his mother to consider&mdash;it&#8217;s
a privilege to know her&mdash;she&#8217;s devoted to the
fellow. Then there&#8217;s Millicent; in a way, she&#8217;s almost
as devoted, anyhow she&#8217;s a staunch friend of his. I
don&#8217;t know how either of them would stand the revelation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would kill Mrs. Gladwyne,&#8221; Nasmyth declared.
</p>
<p>There was silence for a while, and then Lisle spoke
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m badly worried; any move of mine would lead
to endless trouble&mdash;and yet there&#8217;s the black blot on
the memory of the man to whom I owe so much; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
can&#8217;t bring myself to let it remain. Besides all this,
there&#8217;s another complication.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young Crestwick&#8217;s somehow connected with it,&#8221;
Nasmyth guessed.
</p>
<p>Lisle did not deny it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That crack-brained lad seems to be the pivot on
which the whole thing turns. Curious, isn&#8217;t it? I
wish the responsibility hadn&#8217;t been laid on my shoulders.
Just now I can&#8217;t tell what I ought to do&mdash;it&#8217;s
harassing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t force things; wait for developments,&#8221; Nasmyth
advised him. &#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to extract information;
the only reason I mentioned the subject is
that a man in the home counties has asked me to come
up for a few weeks and bring you along. He&#8217;s a
good sort, there&#8217;s fair sport, and it&#8217;s a nice place;
but I don&#8217;t mind in the least whether I go or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;d rather stay. I&#8217;ve a feeling that I may
be wanted here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite satisfied, for a reason I&#8217;ll explain. You
have ridden that young bay horse of mine. He comes
of good stock and he&#8217;s showing signs of an excellent
pace over the hurdles. Now I couldn&#8217;t expect to
enter him for any first-rate event&mdash;he&#8217;s hardly fast
enough and it&#8217;s too expensive in various ways&mdash;but
there&#8217;s a little semi-private meeting to be held before
long at a place about thirty miles off. I might have
a chance there if we put him into training immediately.
You know something about horses?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; responded Lisle. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made one
long journey in the saddle in Alberta; but you&#8217;ve seen
our British Columbian trails. Our cayuses have generally
to climb, and as a rule I&#8217;ve used horses only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
for packing. Still, I&#8217;m fond of them; I&#8217;d be interested
in the thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One difficulty is that there&#8217;s nothing in the neighborhood
that I could try him for pace against except
that horse of Gladwyne&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d no doubt let you have the beast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible,&#8221; Nasmyth agreed dryly. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve
objections to being indebted to him; and I don&#8217;t want
Batley, Marple and Crestwick to take a hand in and
put their money on me. However, we&#8217;ll think it over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They retired to sleep soon afterward; and the next
day Lisle walked across to call on Gladwyne, in a
quietly determined mood. Clarence was in his library,
and he looked up with some curiosity when Lisle was
shown in. Lisle came to the point at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve no doubt noticed that Jim Crestwick has
been going pretty hard of late,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bets,
speculation, and that sort of thing. He can&#8217;t keep
it up on a minor&#8217;s allowance. It will end in a bad
smash if he isn&#8217;t checked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne&#8217;s manner became supercilious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fail to see how it concerns you, or, for that matter,
either of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t go into the question&mdash;it&#8217;s beside the
point. What I want you to do is to pull him up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke as if he meant to be obeyed, and Gladwyne
looked at him in incredulous astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose I&#8217;m able to restrain the lad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be,&#8221; Lisle answered coolly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
your friend Batley who&#8217;s leading him on to ruin; I&#8217;m
making no comments on your conduct in standing by
and watching, as if you approved of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>The man grew hot with anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for your consideration.&#8221; His tone
changed to a sneer. &#8220;I suppose you couldn&#8217;t be expected
to realize that the attitude you&#8217;re adopting is
inexcusable?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t like it, I&#8217;ll try another,&#8221; Lisle returned
curtly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll give Batley his orders to
leave the lad alone right now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne rose with his utmost dignity, a fine gentleman
whose feelings had been outraged by the coarse
attack of a barbarian; but Lisle waved his hand in
a contemptuous manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop where you are; that kind of thing is thrown
away on me. You&#8217;re going to listen for a few
minutes and afterward you&#8217;re going to do what I
tell you. To begin with&mdash;why, after you&#8217;d opened
it, didn&#8217;t you wipe out all trace of the cache on the
reach below the last portage your cousin made?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The shot obviously reached its mark, for Gladwyne
clutched the table hard, and then sank back limply
into his seat. He further betrayed himself by a swift,
instinctive glance toward the rows of books behind
him, and Lisle had no doubt that the missing pages
from George Gladwyne&#8217;s diary were hidden among
them. He waited calmly, sure of his position, while
Gladwyne with difficulty pulled himself together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any proof that I found the cache?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Lisle informed him. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll let
that slide. You&#8217;d better take the thing for granted.
I&#8217;m not here to answer questions. I&#8217;ve told you
plainly what I want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was silence for nearly a minute during which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
Gladwyne sat very still in nerveless dismay. All resistance
had melted out of him, his weakness was manifest&mdash;he
could not face a crisis, there was no courage
in him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The miserable young idiot!&#8221; he broke out at
length in impotent rage. &#8220;This is not the first
trouble in which he has involved me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Lisle. &#8220;Not long ago his sister
came here, begging you to save him, and you wouldn&#8217;t.
It&#8217;s not my part to point what she must think of you.
But I&#8217;m in a different position; you won&#8217;t refuse me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne leaned forward, gripping the arms of his
chair as if he needed support, and his face grew
haggard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The difficulty is that I&#8217;m helpless,&#8221; he declared.
</p>
<p>Lisle regarded him with contempt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brace up,&#8221; he advised him. &#8220;The fellow you&#8217;re
afraid of is only flesh and blood; he has his weak
point somewhere. Face him and find it, if you can&#8217;t
talk him round. There&#8217;s no other way open to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A brief silence followed; and then Gladwyne broke
it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try. But suppose I can induce him to leave
Crestwick alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So much the better for you,&#8221; Lisle answered with
a dry smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m not here to make a bargain. I
don&#8217;t want anything for myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out, consoling himself with the last reflection,
for the part he had played had been singularly
disagreeable. Passing down the wide staircase and
through the great hall, he turned along the terrace
with a sense of wonder and disgust. It was a stately
house; the wide sweep of lawn where two gardeners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
were carefully sweeping up the leaves, the borders beyond
it, blazing with dahlias and ranks of choice chrysanthemums,
conveyed the same suggestion of order,
wealth and refinement. One might, he thought, have
expected to find some qualities that matched with these&mdash;dignity,
power, a fine regard for honor&mdash;in the
owner of such a place, but he had not even common
courage. An imposing figure, to outward seeming, the
Canadian regarded him as one who owed everything to
a little surface polish and his London clothes.
</p>
<p>Lisle paused to look back when he reached the end
of the terrace, from which a path that would save him
a short walk led through a shrubbery. One wing of
the building was covered with Virginia creeper that
glowed with the gorgeous hues of a fading maple leaf,
the sunlight lay on the grass, and the feeling of tranquillity
that hung about the place grew stronger.
He thought that he could understand how the desire
to possess it would stir an Englishman reared in such
surroundings, and yet he was now convinced that this
was not the impulse which had driven Gladwyne into
deserting his starving cousin. The man had merely
yielded to craven fear.
</p>
<p>He heard footsteps, and looking around was a little
surprised to see Batley moving toward him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have just called on Gladwyne,&#8221; Batley began.
</p>
<p>Lisle stopped. There was, so far as he knew, nothing
to be said in favor of the man, but his cool boldness
was tempered by a certain geniality and an
occasional candor that the Canadian could not help appreciating.
He preferred Batley to Gladwyne.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; he agreed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m inclined to think your visit concerned me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
I&#8217;ve noticed your interest in young Crestwick&mdash;it&#8217;s
obvious&mdash;I don&#8217;t know whether one could say the
same of the cause of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t discuss that. If you have anything
to say to me, you had better adopt a less offensive
style.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Batley smiled good-humoredly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quick at resenting things. I don&#8217;t see
why you should expect a longer patience from me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect anything from you,&#8221; Lisle informed
him. &#8220;In proof of it, I&#8217;ll mention that I called to
tell Gladwyne he must keep you off of Jim Crestwick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made a slip in the last few words, which the
other quickly noticed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ordered him, in fact,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Lisle made no answer and Batley resumed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have some kind of a hold on Gladwyne; so
have I. Of course, it&#8217;s no news to you. I&#8217;m a little
curious to learn what yours consists of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It struck me that we might work together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going in for card-sharping or anything of
that kind!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man seemed roused by this, but he mastered his
anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Civility isn&#8217;t expensive and sometimes it&#8217;s wise,&#8221;
he observed. &#8220;I won&#8217;t return the compliment; in fact,
I&#8217;ll credit you with the most disinterested motives. All
I mean is that I might help you and you might help
me. I&#8217;m not quite what you seem to think I am, and if
I can get my money back out of Gladwyne I won&#8217;t
harm him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care in the least whether you harm him or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
not. But I&#8217;ll try to arrange that you drop Crestwick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Batley considered this for a moment or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry we can&#8217;t agree; but as
regards Crestwick you can only head me off by forcing
Gladwyne to interfere. Between ourselves, do you
think he&#8217;s a man who&#8217;s likely to take a bold course?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so&mdash;in the present case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean if the pressure&#8217;s sufficient. Now you
have given me a glimpse at your hand and I&#8217;ll be candid.
Gladwyne rather let me in, and there&#8217;s a risk in
dealing with a lad who&#8217;s to all intents and purposes a
minor; I&#8217;ve gone about as far with him as I consider
judicious. Don&#8217;t do anything that may damage Gladwyne
financially without giving me warning, and in return
I&#8217;ll let Crestwick go. To some extent, I only
got hold of him as an offset to the trouble I&#8217;ve had
with Gladwyne. Is it a bargain? You can trust me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let it go at that,&#8221; replied Lisle. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
keep my eye on you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Batley&#8217;s gesture implied that he would not object
to this, and he turned away, leaving the Canadian to
walk back to Nasmyth&#8217;s thoughtfully. Lisle did not
think he had done Gladwyne much harm by his tacit admissions,
and he had some degree of confidence in Batley&#8217;s
assurance.
</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A BAD FALL</h3>
</div>

<p>Gladwyne spent the first few days that followed
Lisle&#8217;s visit in a state of dread and indecision.
He had allowed the Canadian to
understand that he would endeavor to prevent Crestwick&#8217;s
being further victimized, but he had already
failed to induce Batley to abandon the exploitation of
the lad and he had no cause for believing that a second
attempt would be more successful. Moreover, he
shrank from making it; the man had shown him clearly
that he would brook no interference.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, he was equally afraid of Lisle.
This cool, determined Canadian was not to be trifled
with, and he knew or suspected enough about the tragedy
in British Columbia to make him dangerous. It
was certain that a revelation of Batley&#8217;s speculation
would go a very long way toward establishing the
truth of any damaging story Lisle thought fit to tell.
Supposing the two by any chance combined their
knowledge&mdash;that he had raised money in anticipation
of his cousin&#8217;s death, and afterward left him to perish&mdash;nothing
that he could say would count against the
inference. George had been a healthy man, not much
older than Clarence, when the money was borrowed,
and his decease within a limited time had appeared improbable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
Nobody would believe the actual truth that
Batley with characteristic boldness had, in return for
what he thought a sufficient consideration in the shape
of an exorbitant interest, taken a serious risk. The
thing would look like a conspiracy between the heir
presumptive and the speculator who lent the money;
and in this, for a bold man, there might have been a
loophole for escape, but Gladwyne knew that he had
not the nerve to use the fact against his ally.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Gladwyne was really guiltless in one
respect&mdash;he had not desired his cousin&#8217;s death; he
would have gone back to the rescue had he not dreaded
that he would share George&#8217;s fate. Lack of courage
had been his bane, and it was so now, for instead of
speaking to Batley he temporized. The man had made
no further attempt upon Crestwick, and Gladwyne decided
that until he did so there was no need for him to
interfere. Still, as the next few weeks passed, he was
conscious of a growing dread of the Canadian which,
as sometimes happens, became tinged with hatred.
Lisle was the more serious menace, and it was ominous
that he now and then exchanged a word or two with
Batley. If the two formed an offensive alliance, he
would be helpless at their hands.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Nasmyth has been training his
horse for the approaching meeting and after trying
him against one belonging to a neighbor and not finding
it fast enough he had reluctantly fallen back on
a chestnut owned by Gladwyne. The animal possessed
a fine speed and some jumping powers. Its
chief fault was a vicious temper; but Gladwyne was
seldom troubled by lack of nerve in the saddle. It
was in time of heavy moral strain that he failed, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
he was glad to arrange with Nasmyth for a sharp
gallop.
</p>
<p>Somewhat to the latter&#8217;s regret, news of his intentions
had spread, and on the morning of the trial a
number of people, including the Marples and Crestwicks
and Millicent, had gathered about the course.
It was a dark day, with a moist air and a low, gray sky.
The grass was wet, a strip of plowing which could not
be avoided was soft and heavy, and the ground in
front of several of the jumps was in a far from satisfactory
state. Nasmyth, who kept a very small establishment
and had hitherto generally ridden the horse,
walked round part of the course with Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be heavy going and there&#8217;s a nasty greasy
patch at the biggest fence,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d have waited
for a better day only that it&#8217;s often wet where they
have the meeting, and I want to see what he can do
over ground like this. You&#8217;ll have to watch him at
the jumps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d do better with you in the saddle,&#8221; Lisle suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather put you up. I&#8217;m not going to ride at
the meeting; I&#8217;m over the weight they ought to give
him and I want to get him used to a stranger&#8217;s hands.
As it&#8217;s an outside event of no importance, I haven&#8217;t
fixed on my man yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked back toward the starting-point, where
Gladwyne was waiting, with Batley and Crestwick in
attendance. As they approached it, Millicent joined
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to ride to-day?&#8221; she asked Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nasmyth insists,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
I won&#8217;t do him much credit.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>Gladwyne looked up with a slight frown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t mind?&#8221; Nasmyth asked him. &#8220;I&#8217;d
penalize the horse by nearly a stone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Gladwyne, shortly; &#8220;there&#8217;s no reason
why I should object.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was true, but he had an unreasoning aversion
to facing this opponent. Of late, the Canadian had
caused him trouble at almost every turn, and it looked
as if he could not even indulge in a morning&#8217;s amusement
without being plagued with him. He was conscious
of a most uncharitable wish that Lisle would
come to grief at one of the fences and break his neck.
In many ways, this would be a vast relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would anybody like to make it a sporting
match?&#8221; Crestwick asked. &#8220;The bay&#8217;s my fancy;
I&#8217;m ready to back it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella tried to catch his eye, but he disregarded this.
She, however, saw Lisle glance at Batley and noticed
the latter&#8217;s smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t worth while betting on trials,&#8221; Batley declared.
&#8220;Better wait until the meeting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl was less astonished than gratified. Gladwyne
was surprised and disconcerted. He had said
nothing to Batley about Crestwick, but he had noticed
Lisle&#8217;s warning glance, and the other&#8217;s prompt acquiescence
appeared significant. It looked as if the two
had joined hands, and that was what he most dreaded.
An almost overpowering rage against the Canadian
possessed him. When he attempted to mount, the
chestnut gave him trouble by backing and plunging;
but the bay was quiet and Nasmyth stood for a few
moments by Lisle&#8217;s stirrup.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Save him a bit for the second round,&#8221; he advised.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
&#8220;Another thing, look out when you come to the big-brushed
hurdles, particularly the second time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Batley volunteered as starter, and when he got them
off satisfactorily the spectators scattered, one or two to
watch the pace across the plowed land, the others moving
toward the stiffest jumps&mdash;the course was roughly
circular.
</p>
<p>The trial was a new experience to Lisle, and he
felt the exhilaration of it as, remembering his instructions,
he strove to hold his mount. Gladwyne&#8217;s horse
was a length ahead of him, the wind lashed his face,
and the thrill of the race grew keener when he swept
over the first fence, hard upon the flying chestnut&#8217;s
heels. He dropped another length behind as they
crossed the next field and labored over the sticky plowing;
then there was a low fence and ditch, a narrow
meadow, and then the hurdles Nasmyth had mentioned,
filling a gap in a tall thorn hedge. They were wattled
with branches which projected a foot or so above them.
</p>
<p>It did not look an easy jump and the grass was slippery
and soft, but the chestnut accomplished it cleverly
and the bay flew at the hurdles with every sign
of confidence. Then, though Lisle felt the hoofs slide
as the beast took off, they were over and flying faster
than ever across a long, wet field. As they approached
the end of the first round, the chestnut began to drop
back; Lisle could let the bay go and he determined to
bring him home the winner. It was his first fast ride
in England; and he had, indeed, seldom urged a horse
to its utmost pace&mdash;the British Columbian trails, for
the most part, led steeply up or down rugged hillsides,
where speed was out of the question. It was very different
on these level English meadows, though the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
ground was softer than usual and the fences were
troublesome. He rode with a zest and ardor he had
hardly expected to feel.
</p>
<p>He led at the next fence and some of the onlookers
shouted encouragement when, drawing a little farther
ahead, he once more reached the sticky plowed land.
Here the bay slowed a little, toiling across the clods,
but a glance over his shoulder showed his opponent
still at least two lengths behind. Gladwyne, however,
now roused himself to ride in earnest. Hitherto he
had taken no great interest in the proceedings, but he
had just seen Bella wave her hand to Lisle and then
Millicent&#8217;s applauding smile. He resented the fact
that both should be pleased to see him beaten by this
intrusive stranger. It reawakened his rancor, and the
strain of the last week or two had shaken him rather
badly. He was nervous, his self-control was weak; but
he meant to pass his rival.
</p>
<p>He was still behind at the next fence, but pressing
his horse savagely he crept up a little as they approached
the one really difficult jump; and as they
sped across the narrow meadow Lisle fancied that the
bay was making its last effort. Crestwick was standing
near the hurdles, with Nasmyth moving rapidly
toward them not far away and Bella running across a
neighboring field. Crestwick watched Gladwyne intently.
The man&#8217;s face was strangely eager, considering
that all he had been asked to do was to test the
bay&#8217;s speed, and there was a hardness in his expression
that fixed Crestwick&#8217;s attention; he wondered the cause
of it.
</p>
<p>Bella was close to him, when Lisle, riding hard,
rushed at the hurdles, and Jim found it hard to repress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
a shout as the bay&#8217;s hoofs slipped and slid on the
treacherous turf. The horse rose, however; there was
a heavy crash; wattled branches and the top bar of the
hurdle smashed. Lisle lurched in his saddle; and then
the bay came down in a heap, with the man beneath
him.
</p>
<p>It was impossible to doubt that Gladwyne had seen
the accident, but the chestnut rushed straight at the
shattered hurdle, teeth bare, nostrils dilated, head
stretched forward, and Crestwick thrilled with horror.
The fallen horse was struggling, rolling upon its rider,
just beyond the fence; but Gladwyne did nothing, except
sit ready for the leap. It was incomprehensible;
so was the look in the man&#8217;s face, which was grimly
set, as the big chestnut rose in a graceful bound.
</p>
<p>There was a sickening thud on the other side, a
flounder of slipping hoofs, and the staccato pounding
of the gallop broke out again. The chestnut had come
down upon the fallen horse or helpless man, and was
going on, uncontrollable. Crestwick rushed madly at
the hedge, and scrambling through, badly scratched
and bareheaded, found Nasmyth trying to drag Lisle
clear of the bay. The Canadian&#8217;s eyes were half open,
but there was no expression in them; one arm and shoulder
looked distorted, and his face was gray. Half-way
across the field Gladwyne was struggling savagely with
the plunging chestnut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get hold!&#8221; ordered Nasmyth hoarsely. &#8220;Some
bones broken, by the look of him; but he&#8217;ll have his
brains knocked out in another moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick was cruelly kicked as the bay rolled in
agony, striking with its hoofs; but he stuck to his
task, and with some difficulty they dragged Lisle out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
of danger. When they had accomplished it, Marple
came running up with two or three others and Nasmyth
called to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Came in the car, didn&#8217;t you? Go off for Irvine
as hard as you can drive. Drop somebody at my place
to run back with a gun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Marple swung round and set off across the field, and
Crestwick understood why the gun was wanted when
he glanced at the fallen horse. Nasmyth informed
him that nothing could be done until the doctor came,
and he turned away toward where his sister was waiting.
His forehead and hands were torn and he was
conscious of a bad ache in his back where a hoof had
struck, but these things scarcely troubled him. He
was overwhelmed, horror-stricken; and the shock of
seeing Lisle crushed and senseless was not the only
cause of it. Bella, gasping after her run, with hair
shaken loose about her face, seemed to be suffering
from the same sensation that unnerved him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he dead?&#8221; she asked falteringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Badly hurt, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she exclaimed with intense relief. &#8220;I was
most horribly afraid.&#8221;  She paused before she resumed:
&#8220;You were close by the hurdles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim knew she meant that he must have seen what
happened, but, shaking as he was, he looked hard at
her, wondering in a half-dazed fashion what reply he
should make. He thought her suspicions were aroused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were some way back; you couldn&#8217;t have seen
anything plainly,&#8221; he ventured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very near&mdash;looking back toward them&mdash;when
they crossed the field before the jump. You&#8217;ve
gone all to pieces. What did you see?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t talk about it now,&#8221; Jim broke out. &#8220;He&#8217;s
coming back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne had dismounted and was with some difficulty
leading the chestnut toward the hedge. His face
was white; he moved with a strong suggestion of reluctance;
and when he reached the spot where Lisle
lay he seemed to have trouble in speaking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it dangerous?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; Nasmyth answered sternly. &#8220;Shoulder&#8217;s
smashed; don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the worst. Why
didn&#8217;t you pull up the brute or send him at the hedge
to the right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s hard in the mouth&mdash;you know his temper.
You couldn&#8217;t have turned him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have tried, if I&#8217;d had to bring him down and
break his neck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth checked himself, for this was not the time
for recriminations, and Millicent, who had been running
hard, brushed past them. She did not stop until
she bent over Lisle. Then she turned to Nasmyth with
fear in her strained expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;ll get over it,&#8221; Nasmyth told her. &#8220;I
won&#8217;t take the responsibility of having him moved until
the doctor arrives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; agreed Batley, walking up and casting
a swift and searching glance at Gladwyne.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t let him lie on the wet grass!&#8221; Millicent
expostulated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we must; it&#8217;s safest,&#8221; said Batley.
&#8220;The shock&#8217;s not so much to be dreaded with a man
of his kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He and Nasmyth took charge of the situation,
sternly refusing to listen to all well-meant suggestions,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
until at last the doctor and Marple came hurrying
across the field. The former hastily examined the injured
man and then looked up at Nasmyth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Upper arm gone, close to the shoulder joint,&#8221; he
announced. &#8220;Collar-bone too. I&#8217;ll give him some
brandy. Shout to those fellows with the stretcher.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was busy for some time, and in the meanwhile
Batley picked up the flask he had laid down and handed
it to Gladwyne.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a good drink and pull yourself together,&#8221;
he said quietly.
</p>
<p>At length Lisle was gently lifted on to the stretcher,
and as they carried him away the report of a gun ran
out. The onlookers dispersed and Gladwyne was walking
home alone when Millicent overtook him. She was
puzzled by his limp appearance and the expression of
his haggard face. It was only natural that he should
keenly feel his responsibility for the accident, but
this did not quite seem to account for the man&#8217;s
condition. He looked absolutely unnerved, like one
who had barely escaped from some appalling catastrophe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t take it quite so much to heart,&#8221; she
comforted him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think Irvine felt any great
uneasiness; and nobody could blame you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one who has said so,&#8221; he answered
moodily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t; you stole away. Of course, it&#8217;s a
great pity&mdash;I&#8217;m distressed&mdash;but you must try to be
sensible. These accidents happen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He walked on a while in silence, and then with an
effort looked around at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Millicent,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re wonderfully generous&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
sight of anybody in trouble stirs you&mdash;but I
don&#8217;t feel able to bear your sympathy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have to offer it to Lisle,&#8221; she smiled.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll walk with you to the lodge; and then you
had better go in and keep quiet until you get back
your nerve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she left Gladwyne she went on to Nasmyth&#8217;s,
where she waited until the doctor on leaving told her
that he was perfectly satisfied with the prospect for the
Canadian&#8217;s recovery. It would, he said, be merely a
question of lying still for a considerable time. Millicent
was conscious of a relief which puzzled her by its
intensity as she heard the news, but she asked Nasmyth
to send somebody to inform Gladwyne.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s desperately anxious and feeling the
thing very badly,&#8221; she concluded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he could have come over to inquire, as you
have done,&#8221; Nasmyth answered. &#8220;In my opinion, he
deserves to be uncomfortable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you so hard on him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s face grew grim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had to help Irvine with Lisle, for one thing.
We were satisfied that his injuries were not caused by
the bay rolling on him; he seems to have escaped from
that with a few bad bruises. The worst of the accident
might have been avoided if Clarence had had
nerve enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you couldn&#8217;t blame him very greatly for losing
his head&mdash;he had no warning, scarcely a moment to
think. It was so sudden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The result&#8217;s the same,&#8221; retorted Nasmyth. &#8220;Lisle
has to pay. But to please you I&#8217;ll send Clarence word
that Irvine&#8217;s not anxious about him.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A PRUDENT DECISION</h3>
</div>

<p>It had been dark some time and the night was raw,
but Jim Crestwick strolled up and down the drive
to Marple&#8217;s house, thinking unusually hard. In
the first place, part at least of the folly of his conduct
during the last year or two had been plainly brought
home to him, and the realization was bitter. It was
galling to discover that while he had regarded himself
as a man of the world he had been systematically victimized
by the men who had encouraged him in the delusion.
He felt very sore as he remembered how much
he owed Batley, but this troubled him less than the
downright abhorrence of Gladwyne which had suddenly
possessed him. He had looked up to the latter as a
model and had tried to copy his manners; and it was
chiefly because Batley was a friend of Gladwyne&#8217;s that
he had paid toll to him. For he had felt that whatever
the man he admired was willing to countenance must
be the correct thing. Now he saw Gladwyne as he
really was&mdash;a betrayer of those who trusted him, a
counterfeit of an honorable type, one who had by the
merest chance escaped from crime.
</p>
<p>In the second place, he was concerned about Bella.
She had obviously been attracted by Gladwyne, and it
was his duty to warn her. Whether the warning was
altogether necessary he could not tell&mdash;he had watched
her face that morning&mdash;and Bella sometimes resented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
advice. When she did so, she had an exasperating
trick of putting him in the wrong; but he meant to
speak to her as plainly as appeared desirable. He
had another duty&mdash;to Lisle; but he was inclined to
think that on the whole he had better not saddle himself
with it. His self-confidence had been rudely
shaken and he recognized the possibility of his making
things worse. Moreover, he had cultivated the pride
of caste, and having with some difficulty obtained an
entry to the circle in which Gladwyne moved, he felt it
incumbent on him to guard the honor of all who belonged
to it.
</p>
<p>Presently Bella came out, as he had anticipated, and
joined him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been very quiet since this morning,&#8221;
she began. &#8220;I saw that you meant to slip away as
soon as you could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;I&#8217;ve had something to think
about&mdash;I&#8217;ve been a fool, Bella; the commonest, most
easily gulled kind of imbecile!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had expected her to remind him that she had
more than once tried to convince him of this, but she
failed to do so. Instead, she answered with a touch of
the candor that sometimes characterized her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not the only one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was satisfactory, for it suggested that she had
been undeceived about Gladwyne; but she had not finished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you see this morning?&#8221; she asked, and
he felt that she was speaking with keen anxiety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, but it must never go any farther. I
hate to think of it! But first of all, what makes you
ask?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>She had already mentioned that she had been near
when Gladwyne made his attempt to come up with Lisle,
but she had not explained that she had seen hatred
stamped in hideous plainness on his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; she answered sharply. &#8220;Go on!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;I was standing right against
the hedge, the only person on that side, and I don&#8217;t
think Gladwyne saw me. Lisle&#8217;s bay fouled the top
bar of the hurdle, but it held long enough to bring him
down in a heap. Gladwyne was then a length or two
behind. He rode straight at the broken hurdle, hands
still&mdash;I can&#8217;t get his look out of my mind!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But perhaps he couldn&#8217;t pull up,&#8221; Bella defended
him desperately, as if she would not believe the truth
she dreaded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were other ways open. He could have gone
at the hedge a yard or two on one side; he could have
spoiled the chestnut&#8217;s take-off and made him jump
short. It might have brought him down&mdash;the hurdle
was firm in the ground&mdash;but that would have been
better than riding over a fallen man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure he did nothing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I were not! The thing&#8217;s horrible! Gladwyne
must have seen that he&#8217;d come down on Lisle or
the struggling bay&mdash;he could have prevented it&mdash;he
didn&#8217;t try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella shivered. Her brother was right: it was almost
beyond contemplation. But that was only half
of the matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have had a reason,&#8221; she argued harshly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; one doesn&#8217;t ride over a man in cold-blood for
nothing. I think he had some cause for being afraid
of Lisle; several things I remember now point to it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
His chance came suddenly&mdash;nobody could have arranged
it&mdash;he only remembered that Lisle with his
brains crushed out could do him no harm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl recognized that Jim had guessed correctly.
When she had gone to Lisle for help, he had allowed
her to understand that he could compel Gladwyne&#8217;s
compliance with his request, which was significant.
Still, convinced as she was, she would not openly acquiesce
in her brother&#8217;s theory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she protested, &#8220;if he&#8217;d ridden at the hedge
or made the chestnut jump short, he might have broken
his own neck. He must have realized it&mdash;it would
make him hesitate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad laughed scornfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite possible, but is that any excuse? Would
Nasmyth or Lisle or Batley have shirked a risk that
would mean the saving of the other fellow? Supposing
your idea&#8217;s right&mdash;though it isn&#8217;t&mdash;it only shows
the man as a disgusting coward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no gainsaying this; and Bella was crushed
and humiliated. She had already seen Gladwyne&#8217;s
weakness, and after the choice she had been compelled
to make between him and her brother, she had tried to
drive all thought of him out of her mind. It had been
difficult; he was fascinating in many ways and she had
set her heart upon his capture. Now she had done
with him; after the morning&#8217;s revelation she shrank
from him with positive horror. Jim seemed to guess
this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Bella,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;But the fellow&#8217;s
impossible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laid her hand upon his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;we have both been mad, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
I suppose we must pay for it. I&#8217;ll help you to get
clear of Batley when the time comes, but you must
never have a deal of any kind with him again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s promised; I&#8217;ve had my lesson. I think I&#8217;ll
ask Lisle to take me with him when he goes back to
Canada. He and Nasmyth are the only men worth
speaking of I&#8217;ve met for a long while. When Lisle
first came here I tried to patronize him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella laughed, rather feebly, but she wanted to relieve
the tension.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like you. But we&#8217;ll go in. This is our
secret, Jim. Nobody would believe you if you let fall
a hint as to what really happened, and there are many
reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t. I think you said nobody
else could have suspected?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nasmyth hadn&#8217;t come up when the chestnut
reached the hurdles; he was the nearest. Lisle was
down with the horse upon him. He couldn&#8217;t have seen
anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she decided, &#8220;perhaps that&#8217;s fortunate. It
isn&#8217;t likely that Gladwyne will get such an opportunity
again, and at the worst he acted on the spur of the
moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad nodded. He had felt that silence would
entail some responsibility, but Bella accepted it without
uneasiness. She seldom showed any hesitation
when she had decided on a course.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Gladwyne had spent a miserable
day, alternating between horror of himself and doubts
about the future. Jim Crestwick&#8217;s description of the
incident was correct&mdash;Gladwyne had ridden straight
at the broken hurdle, knowing what the consequences
might be and disregarding them. The next moment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
however, the reaction had begun and he was thankful
that he had not committed a hideous crime. Indeed,
the knowledge that he had come so near to killing his
opponent had left him badly shaken. He wondered at
his insensate action until he recollected how he had once
stood beside an opened cache in Canada, and then, ignoring
his manifest duty, had hurried on through the
frozen wilderness. On that occasion he had been accountable
for his cousin&#8217;s death, and now Lisle had
very narrowly escaped.
</p>
<p>Yet he could with justice acquit himself of any premeditated
intention in either case; fate had thrust him
into a situation he was not strong enough to grapple
with. Dreading Lisle, as he did, his chief thought
had been for his own safety when he saw the bay blunder
at the leap. To save the Canadian he must take
a serious personal risk, which was foreign to his nature,
and though a recognition of the fact that the death
of the fallen man would be a great relief to him had
been clearly in his mind, it was impossible to say how
far it had actuated him.
</p>
<p>He had grown more collected when he sat in his
library as dusk was closing in, considering other aspects
of the affair. He had not seen Crestwick, and
Lisle, he thought, would remember nothing except his
fall. After trying to recall the positions of the others,
he felt comforted; nobody could charge him with anything
worse than reckless riding or a failure of nerve
at a critical moment. He would confess to the latter&mdash;it
was to some extent the truth&mdash;and show concern
about Lisle&#8217;s injury. Awkward as it was, the incident
could be smothered over; it was consoling to remember
that the people he lived among were addicted to treating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
anything of an unpleasant nature as lightly as
possible. There was a good deal to be said for the
sensible English custom of ignoring what it would be
disconcerting to realize.
</p>
<p>After a while his mother came in and gently touched
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she urged, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t brood over it.
Lisle&#8217;s condition&#8217;s satisfactory. As it&#8217;s some hours
since we got Nasmyth&#8217;s message, I sent a man over and
he has just come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you sent,&#8221; Gladwyne responded. &#8220;It
was thoughtful. I forgot; but I&#8217;ve been badly troubled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sat down near him, with her hand laid caressingly
on his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s natural; I understand and feel for you. I
wouldn&#8217;t have liked you to be indifferent; but you
mustn&#8217;t make too much of it. The man is strong, he
will soon be about again, and you couldn&#8217;t have saved
him. Everybody I&#8217;ve seen so far has given me that
impression. Of course, I didn&#8217;t need their assurances,
but I was glad to see they exonerated and sympathized
with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her confidence hurt him; he had still a sense of
shame, and he found no great comfort in what she
told him. His mother was generally loved, and he
wondered how far his neighbors had been influenced by
a desire to save her pain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if Lisle deserves their commiseration
more than I do,&#8221; he answered with a smile which cost
him an effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is being shown. I noticed nearly everybody in
the neighborhood motoring or driving toward the house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
during the afternoon. Millicent&#8217;s with Nasmyth now,
helping to arrange things. It&#8217;s wonderful what a
favorite Lisle has become in so short a time; but I own
that I find something very likable about him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne moved impatiently. His hatred of the
man was as strong as ever, and his mother&#8217;s attempts
at consolation irritated him. Lisle was too popular;
first Bella and now Millicent had taken him in
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Millicent,&#8221; Mrs. Gladwyne went on, &#8220;is an exceptional
woman in every desirable respect. I think you
have long been as convinced of that as I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid she can&#8217;t have an equally favorable
opinion of me,&#8221; he said with a short laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One does not look for perfection in a man,&#8221; his
mother informed him seriously. &#8220;He is criticized
much less severely than a woman. It seems to be the
universal rule, though I have sometimes thought it
wasn&#8217;t absolutely just and that it had its drawbacks.
It&#8217;s one of the things the women who go out and speak
are declaiming against and something one of them
lately said sticks in my mind.&#8221; She sighed as she
added: &#8220;The times are changing; there was no need
to consider such questions in your father&#8217;s case. He
was the soul of honor&mdash;you were very young when
death parted us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did not always express herself clearly, but Gladwyne
saw that she did not place him in the same category
as his father and he recognized her half-formulated
thought that it would have been better had he
grown up under the latter&#8217;s firmer guidance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonders never cease, mother,&#8221; he responded with
an attempt at lightness. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to imagine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
your being influenced by the latest propaganda. I
thought you shuddered at it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I was forgetting what I meant
to talk about, drifting away from the subject; I&#8217;m
afraid it&#8217;s a habit of mine. What I have long felt is
that it would be so desirable if you married suitably.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is to define the suitability. It&#8217;s a
point upon which everybody has a different opinion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would choose a girl of good family and education
for you, one with a well-balanced will, who could
see what was right and cling to it. Still, she must be
wise and gentle; a tactful, considerate guide; and
though means are not of first importance, they are not
to be despised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne leaned back in his chair with a laugh that
had in it a tinge of irritation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are such girls numerous? But why do you insist
on a will and the power of guiding? It looks as if
you thought I needed it. Sometimes you&#8217;re the reverse
of flattering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His mother looked troubled; she would have wounded
no living creature unnecessarily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, it&#8217;s not always easy to express what one
feels, and I dare say I&#8217;m injudicious in choosing my
words. But your welfare is very near to my heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; he answered gently. &#8220;But you were
not describing an imaginary paragon. Hadn&#8217;t you
Millicent in your mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be very happy if I could welcome her as
my daughter. I should feel that you were safe then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a thrill of regret in her voice that touched
him. It hinted that she blamed herself for omissions
and lack of wisdom in his upbringing. Besides, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
confidence in any one who had won her respect, as Millicent
had done, was bestowed so generously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve often given you trouble, and I do
you little credit now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But, as to the other
matter, one can&#8217;t be sure that Millicent would welcome
the idea. Of late I&#8217;ve had a suspicion that she hasn&#8217;t
a very high opinion of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You could hardly expect to gain it by devoting
yourself to Miss Crestwick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man smiled rather grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s any consolation to you, I&#8217;m inclined to think
that Miss Crestwick has let me drop. The truth&#8217;s not
very flattering, but I can&#8217;t hide it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne&#8217;s relief was obvious, but she had
more to say and she ventured upon it with some courage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would only get rid of Batley too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hardly do that just now; he&#8217;s useful in several
ways. Still, of course, if I married&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly, for his mother had occasional
flashes of discernment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Millicent has means,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>He started at this, wondering how much she had
guessed, but he veiled his embarrassment with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he acknowledged, &#8220;means, as you most
wisely remarked, are not to be despised, and mine are
unfortunately small.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She saw that she had said enough and she left him
sitting in the darkening room thinking rather hard.
Bella had thrown him over when he had refused to help
her brother, and there were many ways in which Millicent
appealed to him. Besides, she could free him of
his debt to Batley, which was a thing greatly to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
desired. She had shown that she did not blame him
severely for the accident at the hurdles, but he realized
that in trying to comfort him she had been prompted
by pity for his dejected mood, and it was clear that the
part he had played was scarcely likely to raise him in
her esteem. This was unfortunate, but he would not
dwell on it; there were other points to consider and
anything that served to divert his thoughts from the
unfortunate affair was a vast relief.
</p>
<p>When at last he rose he had partly recovered his
usual equanimity and had decided that he would watch
for some sign of Millicent&#8217;s feelings toward him. He
was aware that they had somewhat changed, but this
was to a large extent his fault, and with caution and
patience he thought it might be possible to reinstate
himself in her favor.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>GLADWYNE GAINS A POINT</h3>
</div>

<p>Some weeks had passed since the accident and
Lisle was lying one afternoon on a couch near
a window of Nasmyth&#8217;s sitting-room. Two or
three Canadian newspapers lay on the floor and he
held a few letters in one hand. The prospect outside
was cheerless&mdash;a stretch of leaden-colored moor running
back into a lowering sky, with a sweep of fir
wood that had lost all distinctive coloring in the foreground.
He was gazing at it moodily when Millicent
came in. His face brightened at the sight of her, and
he raised himself awkwardly with his uninjured arm,
but she shook her head at him in reproof.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had orders to keep as quiet as possible for
some time yet. Lie down again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keeping quiet is fast breaking me up,&#8221; he protested.
&#8220;I&#8217;m quite able to move about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same, you&#8217;re not to try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at her with a twinkle in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose I&#8217;ll have to give in. You&#8217;re a
determined person. People do what you ask them
without resenting it. You have an instance here,
though in a general way it&#8217;s a very undignified thing to
be ordered about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He resumed his former position and she seated herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you should drag my character in,&#8221;
she objected with a smile. &#8220;Other people who occasionally
obey me don&#8217;t say such things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re English; that accounts for a good deal.
I&#8217;m inclined to think my power of expressing my feelings
on any point is a gift, though it&#8217;s one that&#8217;s not
uncommon in the West.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it presuppose an assurance that any one
you address must be interested in your views?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I deserve that,&#8221; he laughed; &#8220;but you&#8217;re not quite
right. We say, in effect, &#8216;These are my sentiments,
but I won&#8217;t be down-hearted if you haven&#8217;t the sense to
agree with them.&#8217; The last, however, doesn&#8217;t apply to
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for the explanation,&#8221; she rejoined.
&#8220;But why do you insist on a national difference?
You&#8217;re really English, aren&#8217;t you, in Canada?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;you and the others who talk
in that strain are mistaken. We&#8217;re a brand new nation
still fusing and fuming in the melting-pot. The elements
are inharmonious in some respects&mdash;French
from the Laurentian littoral, Ontario Scots, Americans,
Scandinavians, Teutons, Magyars, Slavs. The English
element&#8217;s barely strong enough to temper the mixture;
the land&#8217;s too wide and the people too varied for
British traditions to bind. When the cooling amalgam&#8217;s
run out it will be into a fresh mold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One made in Pennsylvania, or wherever the American
foundries are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They run the one you have in mind at Washington.
You understand things a good deal better than
many people I&#8217;ve talked to here; but you&#8217;re not right
yet. If Canadians deliberately chose the American
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
mold because it was American, a number of us would
kick; but the cause is a bigger one than that. From
Texas to Athabasca, from Florida to Labrador, pretty
much the same elemental forces are fanning the melting
fires. We have the same human raw material;
we&#8217;ve much the same problems to tackle; the conditions
are, or soon will be, pretty similar. It&#8217;s only natural
that the result should be more or less identical. I&#8217;ve
said nothing yet about our commercial and social relations
with our neighbors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But doesn&#8217;t England count?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Morally, yes. It&#8217;s your part to keep our respect
and show us a clean lead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; she rejoined, &#8220;you, in particular, are
essentially English by connection with the part of the
country you&#8217;re now staying in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He smiled curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you or Nasmyth have been tracing up the
family!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied with a little sharpness. &#8220;Why
should I have done so? Of course, we knew the name;
and you have relations living at no great distance. I
understand Nasmyth got a hint that they would be
glad to receive you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it go at that,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;My father was
cast out because he dared to think for himself and my
mother was Canadian born. I&#8217;m a unit in the new nation;
one of the rank and file.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She considered this for a moment or two. It was
hardly an English point of view, but&mdash;for his family
had long been one of station&mdash;there was a hint of
pride that struck her as rather fine about this renunciation.
It was a risky thing to insist on being taken at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
one&#8217;s intrinsic value, stripped of all accidental associations
that might enhance it, but she thought he need
not shrink from the hazard. Now and then he spoke
with slightly injudicious candor, and sometimes too
vehemently, but in essential matters he displayed an
admirable delicacy of feeling and she recognized in
him a sterling sense of honor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve broken loose again and you&#8217;re feeling
shocked,&#8221; he said humorously. &#8220;It&#8217;s your own fault;
you have a way of making one talk. There&#8217;s no use
in discoursing to people who don&#8217;t understand. However&mdash;and
it&#8217;s much more important&mdash;how&#8217;s the book
getting on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;More important than my wounded susceptibilities?&#8221;
Millicent laughed. &#8220;But we won&#8217;t mind them.
I&#8217;m pleased to say I&#8217;ve heard from the publishers that
it&#8217;s in strong request. Indeed, they add, rather superfluously,
that the demand is somewhat remarkable, considering
the nature of the work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle laughed at this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any more reviews?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She handed him several and he noticed the guarded,
unenthusiastic tone of the first two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the people who prefer a thing like a
catalogue. This fellow says the first portion of the
book shows most care in particulars and classification&mdash;it&#8217;s
what one would expect from him. That was
your brother&#8217;s work, I think. He was not an imaginative
person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Millicent. &#8220;He was eminently practical
and methodical.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a great deal to be said in favor of that
kind of man. You can trust him when it&#8217;s a case of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
grappling with practical difficulties. But I feel quite
angry with the next reviewer. &#8216;The illustrations are
rather impressionist drawings than a useful guide to
identification.&#8217; The fellow would no doubt rather have
those stiff, colored plates which are about as like the
real, breathing creature as a stuffed specimen in a
museum.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent was pleased with his indignation, but his
disgusted expression changed as he read the next cutting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;we&#8217;re arriving at the sound
sense of ordinary people, lovers of nature who&#8217;re not
naturalists. This man&#8217;s enthusiastic; the next review&#8217;s
even better!&#8221; He took up the others and there
was keen satisfaction in his eyes when he laid them
down. &#8220;Great!&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;I expected it.
You&#8217;ve made your mark!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl thrilled with pleasure; his delight at her
success was so genuine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she told him, &#8220;the publishers suggest that
I undertake another and more ambitious work. I&#8217;ve
often thought that I should like to do so. The lonely
country between the Rockies and the Pacific has a peculiar
interest to me and I&#8217;ve long had a desire to follow
my brother&#8217;s trail. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a morbid
wish&mdash;somehow I feel impelled to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful, wild land, and the creatures that
inhabit it are among the finest in the world. You
promised to let me be your guide, and you should take
Nasmyth, too; he&#8217;s a man to be depended on. You
could start in the early summer next year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She smiled at his eagerness; but he suddenly grew
thoughtful.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s curious how events seem to have started beside
those lonely river-reaches among the rocks,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;It was there that I got to know Nasmyth,
and through him I met you. It was there that I
learned something about your brother and Clarence
Gladwyne. The drama began in those wilds and I&#8217;ve
a feeling that it will end among them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The drama?&#8221; she queried, and he was conscious
that he had made a slip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;before we crossed the big
divide I wasn&#8217;t aware of your existence, and I&#8217;d
only a hazy idea that I might come to England
some day. Now, if I may say it, I&#8217;ve joined your
group of friends and entered into their lives. One
feels it can&#8217;t have sprung from nothing; it isn&#8217;t blind
chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She mused for a few moments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s strange,&#8221; she asserted, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve had something
of the same feeling. You seem to have become
a part of things, a connecting link between us all&mdash;Mrs.
Gladwyne, Clarence, Nasmyth, and even young
Crestwick. One could almost fancy that some mysterious
agency were working upon us through you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not wish her to pursue this train of thought
too far.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve promised to take Jim Crestwick back with
me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going as soon as I&#8217;m fit to get
about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Going back, in a few weeks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. In many ways, I&#8217;m sorry; but I&#8217;ve had some
letters that show it&#8217;s needful. Business calls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She made no reply for some moments. There was
no doubt that she would miss him badly, and she recalled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
the strange and tense anxiety of which she had
been conscious when he had fallen at the hurdles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have come to look upon you as one of us,&#8221; she
told him simply. &#8220;Somehow we never contemplated
your going away, and now it seems an almost unnatural
thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be, if I broke off the connection with my
English friends, but I think that can&#8217;t be done. We&#8217;re
to see more of each other; I&#8217;m to be your guide when
you come out next year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very likely that I shall come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She left him shortly after this and walked home in
a thoughtful mood, regretting his approaching departure
and pondering over what he had said. With
reflection it became clearer that she had entertained
the same idea as his. He and she and the others he
mentioned were not acting and reacting upon one another
casually; it was all a part of a purpose, leading
up to something that still lay unrevealed on the knees
of destiny. Perhaps he had been right in speaking
of a drama; it suggested a sequence of prearranged
events, springing from George&#8217;s death. Reaching
home, she endeavored to banish these thoughts, which
were vaguely troublesome, but Miss Hume found her
preoccupied and absent-minded during the evening.
</p>
<p>The following day she went over to see Mrs. Gladwyne
and was asked to wait until her return. Shortly
afterward, Clarence entered the room where she was sitting,
and she alluded to her visit to Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is going back as soon as he can stand the
journey,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Gladwyne made an abrupt movement and she noticed
with surprise and some indignation the relief in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
expression. Though the men had not been on very
cordial terms, it puzzled her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t attempt to conceal your satisfaction,&#8221;
she commented. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a little ungenerous?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His effort to recover his composure was obvious, but
he answered her quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it is. After the accident&mdash;I think I
was partly blamed for that&mdash;he behaved very well;
told everybody about the slippery ground and said
what he could to exonerate me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to refer to that matter,&#8221; explained
Millicent. She knew that it was a painful one to
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;even if it&#8217;s ungrateful, I am
rather glad he&#8217;s going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Rather glad&#8217; hardly seems to describe it; you
looked overjoyed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be severe, Millicent. Let me explain. Since
Lisle came over, nothing has been quite the same. He
got hold of you and Nasmyth and the others, and in a
way alienated you from me. I don&#8217;t mean he did it
with deliberate intention, but he took up your time
and monopolized your interest. I&#8217;ve seen much less
of both of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, of late, of the Crestwicks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he returned in his most casual manner, &#8220;I
shouldn&#8217;t have had much more of their company in
any case. Jim&#8217;s going to Canada and Bella to Sussex.
I understand from Marple that it will be some
time before she visits us again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent was glad to hear it, but she made no comment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable to blame Lisle,&#8221; Gladwyne went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
on; &#8220;though he did make some unpleasantness with
Batley; but I have had so many annoyances and troubles
since he arrived. Everything has been going
wrong and I can&#8217;t disassociate him from the unfortunate
tendency.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat where the light fell upon his face, and Millicent,
studying it, was stirred to compassion, which was
always ready with her. He looked harassed and nervous,
as if he had borne a heavy strain, and she knew
that the accident had preyed upon his mind. That,
she thought, was to his credit. In addition to this,
she had suspected that he was threatened with financial
difficulties. The man had a dangerous gift of rousing
women&#8217;s interest and sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she said with sincere feeling. &#8220;You
should go away for a time. You need a change.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of it; but I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve been neglecting
things lately and there&#8217;s a good deal that needs
straightening up&mdash;farm buildings to be looked to,
the stream to dyke in the low ground, and that draining
scheme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not all acting; he had meant to give those
matters some attention when he found it convenient,
and she was far from suspicious and was quick to take
the most favorable view of any one. That he recognized
his duties and intended to discharge them gratified
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; she told him, &#8220;that if you undertake
these things in earnest, you&#8217;ll be better for the occupation;
and they certainly need looking after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been slack,&#8221; he owned. &#8220;I seemed to lose interest
and, as I said, I&#8217;ve had difficulties to distract
me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>He had struck the right note again. Anything of
the nature of a confession or appeal for sympathy seldom
failed to stir her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;I&#8217;m not clear of troubles
now. If I do half that I&#8217;m asked to do, it will nearly
ruin me, and I don&#8217;t know where to begin. I haven&#8217;t
any great confidence in Grierson&#8217;s advice; he doesn&#8217;t
seem to grip things readily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that he has his favorites,&#8221; she said
bluntly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he suffers from any lack of
understanding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was unpleasant, but she had courage and the
man was doing Clarence harm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there are people who can get very much
what they ask Grierson for, in the shape of repairs and
improvements, whether they need it or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At my expense, while the rest get less than they
should have?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of your tenants have got practically
nothing for some years. It&#8217;s false economy; you&#8217;ll
have to lay out twice as much as would keep them
here satisfied, when they leave you in disgust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She supplied him with several instances of neglect,
and a few clever suggestions, and he looked at her
in admiration which was only partly assumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What an administrator you would have made!&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;The place would thrive in your hands
and everybody be content. It&#8217;s obvious, quite apart
from his good qualities, why George was so popular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent did not suspect him of an intent to flatter
her, and she recognized that there was truth in what
he said. She knew everybody on the estate and knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
their most pressing needs, and she undoubtedly possessed
the power of management. She had a keen discernment
and could arrive at a quick and just decision.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clarence,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t advise you to
take the business altogether out of Grierson&#8217;s hands.
He&#8217;s honest, so far as you are concerned, and one or
two of the hardest things he did were by your orders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the Milburn and Grainger affair?&#8221;
He showed a little embarrassment. &#8220;Well, perhaps I
was hasty then, but they would have exasperated a
much more patient man. I sometimes feel that I can&#8217;t
please these people, whatever I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She smiled at this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not effusive, but they&#8217;re loyal once you
win their confidence. But, to go back to Grierson&mdash;let
him collect payments and handle the money, but
don&#8217;t ask his advice as to how you will lay it out.
Look around, inquire into things, and trust your own
judgment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned to her beseechingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t trust it in these matters&mdash;it hasn&#8217;t been
cultivated. If I&#8217;m to keep out of further trouble and
do any good, you must help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent hesitated. It was not a little thing he
asked. To guide him aright would need thought and
patient investigation. Still, there was, as she had said,
so much to be done&mdash;abuses to be abolished, houses
to be made habitable, burdens to be lifted from shoulders
unable to carry them. There was also land the
yield from which could be increased by a very moderate
expenditure. She would enjoy the power to do
these things which the man&#8217;s demand for help offered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
her, but she was more stirred by his desire to redeem
past neglect and set right his failures.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she promised, &#8220;you shall have my candid
advice whenever you need it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He showed his gratitude, but he was conscious of a
satisfaction that had no connection with the welfare of
his estate. He would have a legitimate excuse for seeing
her often; the work jointly undertaken would lead
to a closer confidence. He had always cherished a certain
tenderness for her; he must marry somebody with
money before long; and though Millicent&#8217;s means were
not so large as Bella&#8217;s, they were not contemptible.
He had not the honesty to let these thoughts obtrude
themselves, but they nevertheless hovered at the back
of his mind. It was more graceful to reflect that Millicent
possessed refinement, a degree of beauty, and
many most desirable qualities.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>MRS. GLADWYNE&#8217;S TEMPTATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Clarence had gone away with Batley when
Lisle called on Mrs. Gladwyne. She was leaving
home for a visit on the following day and
he wished to say good-by, and, if an opportunity offered,
to ask her opinion upon a matter he had at
heart. She was not a clever woman, but there were
points on which he thought her judgment could be
trusted. He was told that she would be occupied for
a few minutes and was shown into her drawing-room.
He sat down to wait and, though he was familiar with
the house, he looked about him with an interest for
which there was a reason. The room had always impressed
him by its size and loftiness, and it did so
more than ever that afternoon.
</p>
<p>The floor was of hardwood, polished to a glossy luster
by the hands of several generations, and the rugs
scattered here and there emphasized its extent. Most
of the furniture was old, and the few articles apparently
bought in later times harmonized with it.
The faded ceiling had been painted with Cupid&#8217;s trailing
ribands, he judged by some artist of the period
shortly preceding the French Revolution, and two or
three Arcadian figures hinted at the same date. There
were other things&mdash;a luster chandelier, quaintly-wrought
hearth-irons, a carved wood mantel&mdash;that
posited to bygone days.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>It all impressed him with a sense of the continuity
of English traditions and mode of life, as applied to
such families as the Gladwynes. Cradled in a degree
of luxury which nevertheless differed from modern profusion
and ostentation, steeped in a slightly austere
refinement, he could understand their shrinking from
sudden chance and clinging to the customs of the past.
They were all, so far as he had seen, characterized by
the possession of high qualities, with the exception of
Clarence, whom he regarded as a reversion to a baser
type; but he thought that they would suffer if uprooted
and transplanted in a less sheltered and less
cultivated soil. Inherited instincts were difficult to subdue;
he was conscious of their influence. He came
from a new land where he had often toiled for a dollar
or two daily, but a love and veneration for the ancient
English homes in which his people had lived was
growing strong in him.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne did not appear, but he had a good
deal to think of and was content to wait. He had
grown fond of the stately lady and it was, indeed,
largely for her sake that he had decided not to reveal
for a while what he knew about the tragedy in British
Columbia. He could not absolutely prove his version
of the affair, and it would bring distress upon the
mother of the offender; he had already waited two
years and, though he felt that his dead comrade had
a strong claim on him, he could wait a little longer.
Fate might place conclusive evidence in his hands or
remove some of his difficulties. Besides, he must go
back as soon as possible to the Canadian North, and in
one respect he was very loath to do this.
</p>
<p>At last he heard a footstep and his hostess came in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Her dress was not of the latest fashion, but it somehow
struck him as out of place; she ought to have
been attired in the mode of a century ago, with powder
in her hair. Nevertheless, fragile as she was, with her
fine carriage and her gracious smile, she made an attractive
picture in the ancient room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come on an unpleasant errand&mdash;to say good-by&mdash;and
to thank you for many favors shown to a
stranger,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you were never that from the beginning,&#8221;
she told him. &#8220;By and by we learned the reason&mdash;you
really belong to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made a gesture of humorous expostulation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to believe that I belong here, but not because
of the explanation you give. It doesn&#8217;t seem
to be much to my credit that my forefathers lived in
this part of the country; I&#8217;d rather be taken on my actual
merits, if that isn&#8217;t, too egotistical.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They did live here,&#8221; she rejoined. &#8220;You can&#8217;t
get over that&mdash;it has its influence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the point of view he had expected her to
take.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very sorry you are going,&#8221; she continued;
&#8220;somehow we hardly anticipated it. Have you ever
thought of coming back for good?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was unconsciously giving him the lead he desired,
but he would not seize it precipitately; he was
half afraid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, smiling; &#8220;my work&#8217;s out yonder.
I couldn&#8217;t sit idle. I think Miss Gladwyne hit
it when she told me that I was one of the pioneers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His hostess showed more comprehension than he had
looked for.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I set you down as one of the men who prefer
heat and cold, want of food, and toil, to the comforts
they could have at home. I have met a few, sons of
my old friends, and heard of others. After all, we
have a good many of them in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Troublesome people, aren&#8217;t they? What do you
do with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them go. How do we rule India and hold so
much of Africa? How did we open up Canada for
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. It doesn&#8217;t matter that in respect
to Canada the sons of Highland peasants did their
share; the Hudson Bay people and the Laurentian
Frenchmen showed us the way. We found out what
kind of men they were when we went in after them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was silence for a few moments and he glanced
at her with admiration. The honorable pride of caste
she had shown strongly appealed to him. She stood
for all that was fine in the old regime, and once more
he wondered how such a woman could have borne such
a son.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m returning because business calls,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;My means won&#8217;t keep me in idleness, and
that fact has a bearing on the question as to whether
I&#8217;ll ever come back again. It&#8217;s a very momentous one
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She waited, noticing with some surprise the sudden
tenseness of his expression, until he spoke again, hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the only person I can come to for advice.
I&#8217;d be grateful for your opinion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to give it carefully,&#8221; she promised.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the life you people lead here has
its attractions; they must be strong to you. It would
be hard to break with all its associations, to face one
that was new and different; I mean for a woman to
do so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she exclaimed, seeing the drift of his remarks
at last. &#8220;You had better tell me whom you are
thinking of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Millicent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She started. This was a painful surprise, though
she now wondered why she had never suspected it. He
had met the girl frequently before his accident, and
she had since gone over to Nasmyth&#8217;s to talk with him
now and then; yet, for some not very obvious reason,
nobody seemed to have contemplated the possibility of
his falling in love with her. Mrs. Gladwyne had undoubtedly
not done so, and she was filled with alarm.
It was most desirable that Millicent should marry
Clarence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you had this in your mind?&#8221; she
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is more than I can tell you,&#8221; he answered
thoughtfully. &#8220;I admired her greatly the first time I
saw her; I admired her more when we made friends,
but I don&#8217;t think I went much farther for a while. In
Tact, I believe it was only when I knew I must go back
soon that I realized how strong a hold she had on me,
and then I fought against yielding. The difficulties
to be got over looked so serious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Millicent any suspicion of your regard for
her?&#8221; It was an important question and Mrs. Gladwyne
waited in suspense for his reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the slightest, so far as I can tell. I tried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
to hide my feelings until I could come to a decision as
to what I ought to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was satisfactory, provided that his supposition
was correct, and his companion could imagine his exercising
a good deal of self-repression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your fear?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m rough and unpolished compared with
Nasmyth and the rest, but with her large mind she
might overlook that. I couldn&#8217;t live here as Nasmyth
and Clarence do; I&#8217;m not rich enough. My wife, if
I marry, must come out West with me, and I might
have to be away from her for months now and then.
I don&#8217;t know that I could even establish myself in Victoria,
where she would find something resembling your
English society. Besides, my small share of prosperity
might come to an end; I&#8217;m going back now, sooner
than I expected, because there are business difficulties
to be grappled with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne nodded. She could follow his
thought, but after a pause he continued.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What troubles me most is that Millicent seems so
much in harmony with her surroundings. We have
nothing like them in Canada&mdash;anyway, not in the
West. Whether ours are better or worse doesn&#8217;t affect
the case; they&#8217;re widely different. There is much
she would have to give up; what I could offer her in
place of it would be new and strange, less finished,
less refined. Could a woman of your station stand it?
Would she suffer from being torn adrift from the associations
that surround her here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His companion considered. Allowing for his generosity
in thinking first of Millicent, he was a little too
practical and dispassionate. She did not think he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
very greatly in love with the girl as yet, and that
was consoling. What Millicent thought she did not
know, but in many respects the man was eminently
likable. Mrs. Gladwyne had grown fond of him; but
that must not be allowed to stand in her son&#8217;s way.
Clarence came before anybody else.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel my responsibility,&#8221; she said slowly.
&#8220;Would you act on my advice?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so&mdash;it might be hard. Anyway, I&#8217;d try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She hesitated. The man had won her respect. Had
she been wholly free from extraneous influences she
might, perhaps, have counseled him to make the venture,
but half-consciously she tried to see only the
shadows in the picture he had drawn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she answered him, &#8220;until two years ago
Millicent lived in this house&mdash;that must have had its
effect on her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed; &#8220;she shows it. These old
places set their stamp on people&mdash;it&#8217;s very plain
on you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladwyne saw that he understood, but she felt
half guilty as she proceeded:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You admit that you could not give her anything of
this kind in Canada?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed rather grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; our homes were built yesterday, and we move
on rapidly&mdash;they&#8217;ll be pulled down again to-morrow.
I&#8217;ll own that our ideas and manners are in the
same unfinished, transitory stage. We haven&#8217;t been
able to sit down and learn how to be graceful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She made a sign of comprehension, though her reluctance
to proceed grew stronger. He was very honest
and there was pain in his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Millicent,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is essentially one of us, used
to what we consider needful, bred to our ways. The
endless small amenities which make life smooth here
have always surrounded her. Can you imagine her,
for instance, living with the Marples?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied harshly; &#8220;I can&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then do you think it would be wise to take her
to Canada?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have thought she would not mind giving up
many things she values, if one could win her affection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very true; but it doesn&#8217;t get over the difficulty.
It isn&#8217;t so very hard to nerve oneself to make
a sacrifice, it&#8217;s the facing of the inevitable results when
the reaction sets in that tells. She would continually
miss something she had been used to and she would
long for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat silent for nearly a minute, with his face set
hard, and then he looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If Millicent were your daughter, would you let
her go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Mrs. Gladwyne hesitated. His confidence
hurt her; she shrank from delivering what she thought
would be the final blow, but she strove to assure herself
that she was acting in Millicent&#8217;s best interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;not unless she was passionately
attached to the man who wished to take her
out, and then I should do my utmost to dissuade
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made no answer for a few moments. Then
slowly he rose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said gravely. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
you&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s generally hard to do what one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
ought. Well,&#8221;&mdash;he took the hand she held out&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
grateful to you in many ways and I&#8217;d like you to
remember me now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She let him go, and crossing the room to a window,
she watched him stride down the drive with a
swift, determined gait. He might be tried severely,
but there was little fear of this man&#8217;s resolution deserting
him. She was, however, troubled by a recurrence
of the unpleasant sense of guilt when he disappeared;
it was difficult to persuade herself that she had been
quite honest, and the difficulty was new to her.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Lisle walked on rapidly, disregarding
the ache that the motion started in his injured
arm and shoulder. In his dejected mood, the
twinge at every step was something of a welcome distraction.
Since a sacrifice must be made, it should,
he resolved, be made by him; Millicent should not suffer,
though he admitted that he had no reason for
supposing that she would have been willing to do so.
She had never shown him more than confidence and
friendliness, and it was only during the past few weeks
that he had ventured to think of the possibility of winning
her. Even then, the thought had roused no excess
of ardent passion; much as he desired her, a strong
respect and steadfast affection were more in keeping
with his temperament. Nevertheless, had he known that
she loved him and he could confer benefits upon her in
place of demanding a sacrifice, he would have been
strangely hard to deter.
</p>
<p>On his return, Nasmyth met him at the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; he asked with some indignation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To Mrs. Gladwyne&#8217;s,&#8221; Lisle informed him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You walked to the house, after what Irvine said
when you insisted on his taking the bandages off?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I took them off; he only protested. Anyway, I
didn&#8217;t break my leg.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth noticed his gloomy expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he responded, &#8220;I suppose there was very
little use in warning you to keep quiet; but you look
as if you had suffered for your rashness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; answered the Canadian with a grim
smile. &#8220;After all, it&#8217;s what usually happens, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went in, Nasmyth a little puzzled by his companion&#8217;s
manner; but Lisle offered no explanation of
its cause.

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE LAST AFTERNOON</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a bright day when Lisle took his leave of the
Marples. They gave him a friendly farewell and
when he turned away Bella Crestwick walked with
him down the drive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what they think; I couldn&#8217;t talk to
you while they were all trying to say something nice,&#8221;
she explained. &#8220;Still, to do them justice, I believe
they meant it. We are sorry to part with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s soothing to feel that,&#8221; Lisle replied. &#8220;In
many ways, I&#8217;m sorry to go. I&#8217;ve no doubt you&#8217;ll miss
your brother after to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said with unusual seriousness. &#8220;More
than once during the last two years I felt that it would
be a relief to let somebody else have the responsibility
of looking after him, but now that the time has come
I&#8217;m sorry he&#8217;s going. I can&#8217;t help remembering how
often I lost my temper, and the mistakes I made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You stuck to your task,&#8221; commended Lisle. &#8220;I
dare say it was a hard one, almost beyond you now
and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He knew that he was not exaggerating. She was
only a year older than the wilful lad, who must at
times have driven her to despair. Yet she had never
faltered in her efforts to restrain and control him; and
had made a greater sacrifice for his sake than Lisle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
suspected, though in the light of a subsequent revelation
of Gladwyne&#8217;s character she was thankful for this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I suppose that one misses
a load one has grown used to, and I feel very downcast.
It&#8217;s hardly fair to pass Jim on to you&mdash;but I
can trust you to take care of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can trust the work and the country,&#8221; Lisle
corrected her with a trace of grimness. &#8220;He&#8217;s not
going out to be idle, as he&#8217;ll discover. There&#8217;s nothing
like short commons and steady toil for taming any
one. You&#8217;ll see the effect of my prescription when I
send him back again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has physical pluck. I&#8217;m glad to remember it;
and he has shown signs of steadying since he found
Gladwyne out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle looked at her searchingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since he found Gladwyne out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she answered, seeing that she had been incautious,
&#8220;he rather idolized the man, and I suppose
it was painful to discover by accident that he wasn&#8217;t
quite all he thought him. Now, however, he has transferred
his homage to you&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid Jim must always
have somebody to prop him&mdash;but I&#8217;ve no misgivings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seldom had the time to get into mischief; I
suppose that accounts for a good deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were nearing the lodge and she stopped and
held out her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to say good-by; you have helped me more
than you&#8217;ll ever guess, and you won&#8217;t be forgotten.&#8221;
Then as he held her hand with signs of embarrassment
she laughed with something of her usual mocking manner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
and suddenly drew away. &#8220;Good-by,&#8221; she added.
&#8220;I was rather daring once and I suppose you were
shocked. I can&#8217;t repeat the rashness&mdash;it would mean
more now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She walked back toward the house, and he went on.
Half an hour later he met Millicent, who stopped to
greet him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was on my way to call on you for the last time,&#8221;
he told her.
</p>
<p>There was something in his voice that troubled her,
and, though she had expected it, she shrank from the
intimation of his departure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, will you come back with me?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not pressed for time, I&#8217;d rather walk
across the moor, the way you once took me soon after
I came. I&#8217;d like to look round the countryside again
before I leave, though it will be a melancholy pleasure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For no very obvious reason, she hesitated. It was,
however, hard to refuse his last request and she really
wished to go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The views are unusually good,&#8221; she said, as they
started on. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t Nasmyth have gone with
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t have been the same,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;I&#8217;m storing up memories to take away with me and
somehow Nasmyth is most clearly associated with
Canada. When I think of him, it will be as sitting
in camp beside a portage or holding the canoe paddle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you can&#8217;t picture my being occupied in that
way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered gravely; &#8220;I associate you with
England&mdash;with stately old houses, with well-cared-for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
woods and quiet valleys. There&#8217;s no doubt that your
place is here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke as if he were making an admission that was
forced from him, and she endeavored to answer in a
lighter manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only one I&#8217;ve had an opportunity for trying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you love this place!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I love it very well. Perhaps I
am prejudiced, and I&#8217;ve only had a glimpse at other
countries, but I feel that this is the most beautiful
land in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped and glanced round. From where they
stood he could look out upon leagues of lonely brown
moors running back into the distance under a cloudless
sky. Beyond them the Scottish hills were softly
penciled in delicate gray. There was a sense of space
and vastness in the picture, but it was not that which
spoke most plainly to him. Down on the far-spread
low ground lay such white homesteads, built to stand
for generations, as he had never seen in Canada; parks
sprinkled with noble trees, amid which the gray walls
of some ancient home peeped out; plantations made
with loving care, field on field, fenced in with well-trimmed
trimmed hedges.
</p>
<p>It was all eloquent of order, security and long-established
ease; a strong contrast to the rugged wilderness
where, in the bush and on treeless prairie, men never
relaxed their battle with nature. In many ways, his
was a stern country; a land of unremitting toil from
which one desisted only long enough to eat and sleep,
and he was one of the workers. Mrs. Gladwyne
had been right&mdash;it was no place for this delicately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
nurtured girl with her sensitiveness and artistic faculties.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For those who can live as you live, it would be
hard to find the equal of this part of England,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not sure you can keep it very much
longer as it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>It was a relief to talk of matters of minor interest,
for he dare not let his thoughts dwell too much on the
subject that was nearest them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;there&#8217;s the economic pressure,
for one thing; the growth of your cities; the demand
for food. I see land lying almost idle that could be
made productive at a very moderate outlay. Our people
often give nearly as much as it&#8217;s worth here for no
better soil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how do they make it pay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The secret is that they expect very little&mdash;enough
to eat, a shack they build with their own hands to
sleep in&mdash;and they&#8217;re willing to work sixteen hours
out of the twenty-four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t do so in winter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The hours are shorter, but where the winter&#8217;s hardest&mdash;on
the open middle prairie&mdash;the work&#8217;s more
severe. There the little man spends a good deal of his
time hauling home stove-wood or building-logs for
new stables or barns. He has often to drive several
leagues with the thermometer well below zero before
he can find a bluff with large enough trees. In the
Pacific Slope forests, where it&#8217;s warmer, work goes on
much as usual. The bush rancher spends his days
chopping big trees in the rain and his nights making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
odd things&mdash;furniture, wagon-poles, new doors for
his outbuildings. What you would call necessary
leisure is unknown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was not exaggeration; but he spoke of it from
a desire to support his resolution by emphasizing the
sternest aspects of western life. It had others more
alluring: there were men who dwelt more or less at
their ease; but they were by no means numerous, and
the toilers&mdash;in city office, lonely bush, or sawmill&mdash;were
consumed by or driven into a feverish activity.
As one of them, it was his manifest duty to leave this
English girl in her sheltered surroundings. There
was, however, one remote but alluring possibility that
made this a little easier&mdash;he might, after all, win
enough to surround her with some luxury and cultured
friends in one of the cities of the Pacific coast.
Though they differed from those in England, they
were beautiful, with their vistas of snow-capped mountains
and the sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not a farmer,&#8221; she objected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; mining&#8217;s my vocation and it keeps me busy.
In the city, I&#8217;m at work long before they think of
opening their London offices, and it&#8217;s generally midnight
before I&#8217;ve finished worrying engineers and contractors
at their homes or hotels. In the wilds, we&#8217;re
more or less continuously grappling with rock or
treacherous gravel, or out on the prospecting trail,
while the northern summer lasts; it&#8217;s then light most of
the night. In the winter, we sometimes sleep in the
snow, with the thermometer near the bottom of its
register.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent shivered a little, wondering uneasily why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
he had taken the trouble to impress this upon her. It
was, she thought, certainly not to show what he was
capable of.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you glad to go back, or do you dread it?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t dread it&mdash;it&#8217;s my life, and things may be
easier by and by. Still, I&#8217;m very loath to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent could believe that. His troubled expression
confirmed it; and she was strangely pleased. She
had never had a companion in whom she could have
so much confidence, and she had already recognized
that she was, in one sense of the word, growing fond of
him. Indeed, she had begun to be curious about the
feeling and to wonder whether it stopped quite short
at liking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she told him, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad that you asked me
to come with you. I think I was one of your first
friends and I&#8217;m pleased that you should wish to spend
part of your last day in my company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You come first of all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s flattering,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;What about
Nasmyth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An unusually fine man, but he has his limits. You
have none.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I quite understand you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he explained seriously, &#8220;what I think I
mean is this&mdash;you&#8217;re one of the people who somehow
contrive to meet any call that is made on them. You
would never sit down, helpless, in a trying situation;
you&#8217;d find some way of getting over the difficulties.
It&#8217;s a gift more useful than genius.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re rating me too highly,&#8221; she answered with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
some embarrassment. &#8220;You admitted that you
thought my place was here&mdash;the inference was that I
shouldn&#8217;t fit into a different one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he corrected her; &#8220;you&#8217;d adapt yourself to
changed conditions; but that wouldn&#8217;t prevent your
suffering in the process. Indeed, I think people of
your kind often suffer more than the others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was to some extent correct in his estimate of her,
but she shrank from the direct personal application of
his remarks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t the virtues you have described fairly common?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;I think that must be so, because
they&#8217;re so necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a degree, I suppose they are. You see them,
perhaps, most clearly in such lands as mine. The
pioneer has a good deal against him&mdash;frost and floods,
hard rock and sliding snow; he must face every discomfort,
hunger and stinging cold. The prospector
crawls through tangled forests, and packs his stores
across snowy divides; shallow shafts cave in, rude dams
are swept away. A man worked to exhaustion on the
trail runs out of provisions and goes on, starving; he
lames himself among the rocks, sets his teeth and limps
ahead. I&#8217;ve thought the capacity to do so is humanity&#8217;s
greatest attribute, but after all it&#8217;s not shown in
its finest light battling with material things. When
the moral stress comes, the man who would face the
other often fails.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she asserted; &#8220;there are barriers that can&#8217;t
be stormed. Merely to acquiesce is the hardest thing
of all, but in that lies the victory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bitter one,&#8221; he answered moodily.
</p>
<p>There was silence for a few minutes while they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
strolled on through the heather. Afterward, Millicent
understood where his thoughts had led, but now she
was chiefly conscious of a slight but perplexing resentment
against the fact that he should discourse
rather crude philosophy. Indeed, the feeling almost
amounted to disappointment&mdash;it was their last walk,
and though she did not know what she had expected
from him, it was something different from this. Walking
by her side, with his fine poise, his keen eyes that
regarded her steadily when she spoke, and his resolute
brown face, he appealed to her physically, and in other
ways she approved of him. It was borne in upon her
more clearly that she would miss him badly, and she
suspected that he would not find it easy to part from
her. In the meanwhile he recognized that she had, no
doubt unconsciously, given him a hint&mdash;when the
moral difficulties were unsurmountable one must quietly
submit.
</p>
<p>They stopped when they reached the highest strip
of moor. The sun was low, the vast sweep of country
beneath them was fading to neutral color, woods, low
ridges, and river valleys losing their sharpness of
contour as the light left them. A faint cold wind
sighed among the heather, emphasizing the desolation
of the moorland.
</p>
<p>Millicent shivered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go down,&#8221; Lisle said quietly; &#8220;the brightness
has gone. I&#8217;ve had a great time here&mdash;something
to think of as long as I live&mdash;but now it&#8217;s over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll come back some day?&#8221; she suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may; I can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve schemes
in view, to be worked out in the North, that may make
my return possible; but even then it couldn&#8217;t be quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
the same. Things change; one mustn&#8217;t expect too
much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His smile was a little forced; his mood was infectious,
and an unusual melancholy seized upon Millicent
as they moved down-hill across the long, sad-colored
slopes of heather. Then they reached a bare wood
where dead leaves that rustled in the rising wind lay
in drifts among the withered fern and the slender birch
trunks rose about them somberly. The light had almost
gone, the gathering gloom reacted upon both of
them, and there was in the girl&#8217;s mind a sense of something
left unsaid. Once or twice she glanced at her
companion; his face was graver than usual and he
did not look at her.
</p>
<p>It was quite dark when they walked down the dale
beneath the leafless oaks, talking now with an effort
about indifferent matters, until at last Millicent stopped
at the gate of the drive to her house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come in?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Nasmyth&#8217;s waiting. I&#8217;m glad you came with
me, but I won&#8217;t say good-by. I&#8217;ll look forward to the
journey we&#8217;re to make together through British Columbia.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She held out her hand; in another moment he turned
away, and she walked on to the house with a strange
sense of depression.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>STARTLING NEWS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was snowing in the northern wilderness and the
bitter air was filled with small, dry flakes, which
whirled in filmy clouds athwart the red glow of
a fire. A clump of boulders stood outlined beside a
frozen river, and behind the boulders a growth of willows
rose crusted with snow, while beyond them, barely
distinguishable, were the stunted shapes of a few
birches. So far the uncertain radiance reached when
the fire leaped up, but outside it all was shut in by a
dense curtain of falling snow.
</p>
<p>It had been dark for some time, and Lisle was getting
anxious as he lay, wrapped in a ragged skin coat,
in a hollow beside a boulder. A straining tent stood
near the fire, but the big stone afforded better shelter,
and drawing hard upon his pipe, he listened eagerly.
The effort to do so was unpleasant as well as somewhat
risky, for he had to turn back the old fur cap
from his tingling ears; and he shivered at every variation
of the stinging blast. There was nothing to be
heard except the soft swish of the snow as it swirled
among the stones and the hollow rumble of the river
pouring down a rapid beneath a rent bridge of ice.
</p>
<p>The man had spent the early winter, when the snow
facilitates traveling, in the auriferous regions of the
North, arranging for the further development of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
mineral properties under his control. That done, he
had, returning some distance south, struck out again
into the wilds to examine some alluvial claims in which
he had been asked to take an interest. It was difficult
to reach the first of them; and then he had spent several
weeks in determined toil, cutting and hauling in
wood to thaw out the frozen surface sufficiently to
make investigations. Crestwick had accompanied him,
but during the last few days he had gone down to a
Hudson Bay post with the owners of the claim, who
were returning satisfied with the arrangements made.
His object was to obtain any letters that might have
arrived, and Lisle, going on to look at another group
of claims, had arranged to meet him where he had
camped.
</p>
<p>It would be difficult to miss the way, for it consisted
of the frozen river, but Crestwick should have arrived
early in the afternoon and Lisle felt uneasy. On the
whole, the Canadian was satisfied with the conduct of
his companion. Deprived during most of the time of
any opportunity for dissipation, scantily fed, and
forced to take his share in continuous labor, the lad&#8217;s
better qualities had become manifest and he had responded
pluckily to the demands on him. Abstinence
and toil were already producing their refining effect.
Still, he had not come back, and with the snow thickening,
it was possible that he might not be able to keep to
the comparatively plain track of the river. There was
also the risk that by holding on too far when he saw
the fire he might blunder in among the fissured ice at
the foot of the rapid.
</p>
<p>Rising at length, Lisle walked toward the dangerous
spot, guiding himself by sound, for once he was out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
of the firelight there was nothing to be seen but a
white driving cloud. He knew when he had reached
the neighborhood of the rapid by the increased clamor
of the stream, and he crept on until he decided that he
was abreast of the pool below. The rapid was partly
frozen, but the ice was fissured and piled up at the tail
of it.
</p>
<p>Lisle could not remember how long he waited, beating
his stiffened hands and stumbling to and fro to
keep his feet from freezing, but at last, though he
could see nothing, he heard a crunching sound, and he
called out sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got here!&#8221; came the answer. &#8220;Where shall
I leave the ice? Seems to be an opening in front of
me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was difficult to hear through the clamor of the
water and the crash of drifting ice; but Lisle caught
the words and called again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn your back on the wind and walk straight
ahead!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He supposed that Crestwick was obeying him, but
a few moments later he heard a second shout:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brought up by another big crack!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The voice was hoarse and anxious, and Lisle, deciding
that the lad was worn out by his journey and probably
confused, bade him wait, and hurrying down-stream a
little he moved out upon the frozen pool. He proceeded
along it for a few minutes, calling to Crestwick
and guiding himself by the answers; and then he
stopped abruptly with a strip of black water close beneath
his feet. On the other side was a ridge of
rugged ice; but what lay beyond it he could not
see.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in among a maze of cracks; can&#8217;t find any
way out!&#8221; Crestwick cried, answering his hail.
</p>
<p>Lisle reflected rapidly as he followed up the crevasse,
which showed no sign of narrowing. The snow was
thick, the bitter wind increasing, and a plunge into
icy water might prove disastrous. It was obvious that
he must extricate his companion as soon as possible,
but the means of accomplishing it was not clear. Crestwick
was somewhere on the wrong side of the crack,
which seemed to lead right across the stream toward
the confusion of broken ridges and hummocks which,
as Lisle remembered, fringed the opposite bank. He
must endeavor to find the place where the lad had got
across; but this was difficult, for fresh breaches and
ridges drove him back from the edge. Presently the
chasm ended in a wide opening filled with an inky
flood, and Lisle, turning back a yard or two, braced
himself and jumped.
</p>
<p>He made out a shapeless white object ahead, and
coming to another crack he scrambled to the top of
an ice-block and leaped again. There was a sharp
crackle when he came down, the piece he alighted on
rocked, and Crestwick staggered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s tilting under!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle saw water lapping in upon the snow, but it
flowed back, and the cake he had detached impinged
upon the rest with a crash.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;The stream will jamb
it fast!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They reached the larger mass and moved across it,
but Lisle, clutching his companion&#8217;s arm, bewildered
and almost blinded by the snow, doubted if he were
retracing his steps. He did not remember some of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
ridges and ragged blocks over which they stumbled, and
the smaller rents seemed more numerous. It was evident
that Crestwick was badly worn out and they must
endeavor to reach the bank with as little delay as possible.
</p>
<p>At last they came to the broad crevasse, farther up
the stream, and Lisle turned to Crestwick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better take off your skin-coat. You&#8217;ll have to
jump.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said the other dejectedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
nerve&mdash;the thing&#8217;s clean beyond me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His slack pose&mdash;for he was dimly visible amid the
haze of driving snow&mdash;bore out his words. The long
march he had made had brought him to the verge of
exhaustion; his overtaxed muscles would respond to no
further call on them. For a moment or two Lisle
stood gazing at the dark water in the gap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll look for a narrower place,&#8221; he decided.
&#8220;Where did you get across?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Don&#8217;t remember this split, but the
ice was working under me. Perhaps the snow had
covered it and now it&#8217;s fallen in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They scrambled forward, following the crevasse,
but could find no means of passing it and now and then
the ice trembled ominously. At last, when the opposite
side projected a little, Lisle suddenly sprang out from
the edge and alighted safely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy!&#8221; he called, stripping off his long skin
coat and flinging one end of it across the chasm to
Crestwick. &#8220;Get hold and face the jump!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not a time for hesitation; the exhausted lad
dare not contemplate the gap, lest his courage fail him,
and nerving himself for an effort, he leaped. Striking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
the edge on the other side, he plunged forward as
Lisle dragged at the coat, and then rolled over in the
snow. He was up in a moment, gasping hard, almost
astonished to find himself in security, and Lisle led him
back to the snow-covered shingle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me as fortunate that I came to look for
you,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;You&#8217;d probably have ended by
walking into the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Crestwick simply. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t the
first hole you&#8217;ve pulled me out of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They reached the camp and the lad, shaking the
snow off his furs, sat down wearily on a few branches
laid close to the sheltering boulder, while Lisle took a
frying-pan and kettle off the fire, and afterward filled
his pipe again and watched his companion while he ate.
Crestwick had changed since he left England; his face
was thinner, and the hint of sensuality and empty self-assurance
had faded out of it. His eyes were less bold,
but they were steadier; and, sitting in the firelight, clad
in dilapidated furs, he looked somehow more refined
than he had done in evening dress in Marple&#8217;s billiard-room.
When he spoke, as he did at intervals, the confident
tone which had once characterized him was no
longer evident. He had learned to place a juster estimate
upon his value in the icy North.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was uncommonly glad to see the fire,&#8221; he said at
length. &#8220;Another mile or two would have beaten me;
though I spent nearly twice as long in coming up from
the Forks as the prospectors said it would take. I was
going light, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve been doing this kind of thing most of
their lives. You couldn&#8217;t expect to equal them.
Where did you sleep last night?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In some withered stuff among a clump of willows;
I scraped the snow off it. That is, I lay down there,
but as the fire wouldn&#8217;t burn well, I don&#8217;t think I got
much rest. Part of the time I wondered what I was
staying in this country for. I didn&#8217;t seem to find any
sensible answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You could get out of it when the freighters go
down with the dogs and sledges,&#8221; Lisle suggested. &#8220;It
would be a good deal more comfortable at Marple&#8217;s, for
instance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to get rid of me? I suppose I&#8217;m not
much help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; Lisle assured him. &#8220;It only struck me
that you might find the novelty of the experience
wearing off. Besides, you&#8217;re improving; in a year
or two you&#8217;ll make quite a reliable prospector&#8217;s
packer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something,&#8221; replied Crestwick, grinning.
&#8220;Not long ago I thought I&#8217;d make a sportsman; one
of Gladwyne&#8217;s kind. The ambition doesn&#8217;t so much
appeal to me now. But I want to be rather more than
a looker-on. Can&#8217;t you let me put something into one
of these claims?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a cent! In the first place, you&#8217;d have some
trouble in raising the money; in the second, I might be
accused of playing Batley&#8217;s game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The last&#8217;s ridiculous. But if I&#8217;m not to do anything,
it brings me back to the question&mdash;why am I
staying here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that. I&#8217;ll only suggest that if you
hold out until you come into your property, you&#8217;ll go
back much more fit in several ways to look after it. I
should imagine you&#8217;d find less occasion to emulate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
people like Batley and Gladwyne then. Of course,
I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s worth waiting for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the nearest approach to seriousness he considered
advisable, for precept was obnoxious to him
and apt to be resented by his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;what about the mail?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick produced a packet of letters which he had
not opened yet and Lisle glanced at two business communications.
The boulder kept off most of the snow,
and the glare of the snapping branches, rising and
falling with the gusts, supplied sufficient light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s from Bella; there&#8217;s news in it,&#8221; Crestwick
remarked. &#8220;She says Carew&mdash;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve
seen him&mdash;is anxious to marry her, and if she&#8217;s convinced
that I&#8217;m getting on satisfactorily, she&#8217;ll probably
agree. He&#8217;s&mdash;I&#8217;m quoting&mdash;about as good as
she&#8217;s likely to get; that&#8217;s Bella all over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he like?&#8221; Lisle asked with interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, in one way I think she&#8217;s right&mdash;the
man&#8217;s straight; not the Marple crowd&#8217;s style. In
fact, I found him decidedly stand-offish, though I&#8217;ll
own there might have been a reason for that. Anyhow,
I&#8217;m glad; she might have done a good deal worse.
I suppose you won&#8217;t mind giving me a testimonial that
will set her doubts at rest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall have it. Since the man&#8217;s a good one,
I&#8217;m nearly as glad as you are. I&#8217;ve a strong respect
for your sister; she stood by you pluckily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; asserted Crestwick. &#8220;I was a bit
of an imbecile, and she&#8217;s really hard to beat. She says
if the life here&#8217;s too tough for me I&#8217;m to come back
and live with them. That&#8217;s considerate, because in a
way she can&#8217;t want me, though I haven&#8217;t the least doubt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
she&#8217;d make Carew put up with my company. It decides
the question&mdash;I&#8217;m not going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A little while ago you&#8217;d have taken Carew&#8217;s delight
for granted, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to see things,&#8221; Crestwick answered
with a wave of his hand. Then he paused and looked
confused. &#8220;After all, though she says I&#8217;m to give
you the message, Bella really goes too far now and
then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t always mean it. You may as well
obey her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this&mdash;if it&#8217;s any consolation, she has no intention
of forgetting you, and Arthur&mdash;that&#8217;s the
fellow&#8217;s name&mdash;is anxious to make your acquaintance.
She says there are men who&#8217;re not so unresponsive as
you are, but Arthur has never been into the North to
get frozen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle laughed&mdash;it was so characteristic of Bella.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s something else,&#8221; Crestwick proceeded;
&#8220;about Miss Gladwyne. Bella thinks you&#8217;d be interested
to hear that there&#8217;s a prospect of&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; cried Lisle, dropping his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see,&#8221; said Crestwick. &#8220;You might stir
the fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle threw on some fresh wood and poked the fire
savagely with a branch, and the lad continued, reading
with difficulty while the pungent smoke obscured the
light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that she saw Gladwyne and his mother
and Millicent together in town, and she afterward
spent a week with Flo Marple at somebody&#8217;s house.
Flo told her that it looks as if the long-deferred arrangement
was to be brought about at last.&#8221; He laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
down the letter. &#8220;If that means she&#8217;s to marry Gladwyne,
it ought to be prevented!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They looked at each other curiously, and Lisle,
struggling to command himself, noticed the lad&#8217;s
strained expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked with significant shortness.
</p>
<p>Crestwick seemed on the verge of some vehement outbreak
and Lisle saw that it was with an effort he refrained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;the man&#8217;s not half good
enough. He&#8217;s a dangerous rotter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dangerous?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Crestwick dryly; &#8220;I think that
describes it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was an impressive silence, while each wondered
how far he might have betrayed himself. Then Lisle
spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Read the rest of the letter. See if Bella says anything
further.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No announcement made,&#8221; Crestwick informed him
a little later. &#8220;All the same, Flo&#8217;s satisfied that the
engagement will be made known before long.&#8221; He
looked up at Lisle with uncertainty and anger in his
face. &#8220;It almost makes me forget Bella&#8217;s other news.
What can be done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fence!&#8221; said Crestwick. &#8220;I&#8217;m not smart at
it. Don&#8217;t you know a reason why Miss Gladwyne
shouldn&#8217;t marry the fellow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It has nothing to do with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; replied Crestwick. &#8220;I can only
say that the match ought to be broken off. It isn&#8217;t
to be contemplated!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Lisle responded with forced quietness, &#8220;if
it&#8217;s any relief to you, I&#8217;ll write to Nasmyth the first
chance I get, asking what he&#8217;s heard. Now we&#8217;ll drop
the subject. Is there anything else of general interest
in your letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bella says her wedding won&#8217;t be until the early
summer and she&#8217;s thinking of making Carew bring
her out to Banff or Glacier&mdash;he came out shooting or
climbing once before. Then she&#8217;ll endeavor to look
us up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He lighted his pipe and they sat in silence for a
while. Then Crestwick rose and bringing a blanket
from the tent wrapped it about him and lay down in
the lee of the boulder near the fire. A few minutes
later he was sound asleep; but Lisle sat long awake,
thinking hard, while the snow drove by above him.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>A FORCED MARCH</h3>
</div>

<p>When Crestwick awakened, very cold, and
cramped, a little before daylight the next
morning, it was still snowing, but Lisle was
up and busy preparing breakfast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That looks like marching; I thought we were going
to lie off to-day,&#8221; observed the lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; Lisle inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Horribly stiff; but that&#8217;s the worst. Why are you
going on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the freighters should leave the Hudson
Bay post to-morrow with their dog-teams. It&#8217;s the
only chance of sending out a letter I may get for a
long while, and I want to write to Nasmyth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick shivered, glancing disconsolately at the
snow; he shrank from the prospect of a two days&#8217; hurried
march. Had Lisle suggested this when he first
came out, the lad would have rebelled, but by degrees
the stern discipline of the wilds had had its effect on
him. He was learning that the weariness of the flesh
must be disregarded when it is necessary that anything
shall be done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; he acquiesced, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try to make it. If
I can&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll have to drop me where there&#8217;s some
shelter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He ate the best possible breakfast, for as wood was
scarce in parts of the country, and making a fire difficult,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
it was very uncertain when he would get another
meal. Then he slipped the pack-straps over his stiff
shoulders, and got ready to start with a burden he did
not think he would have been capable of carrying for
a couple of hours when he left England.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll pull out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But wait a moment:
I&#8217;d better look for a dry place to put this paper
currency.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get it? You told me at the last
settlement that you had hardly a dollar left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick grinned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, some of the boys offered to teach me a little
game they were playing when we thawed out that claim.
I didn&#8217;t find it difficult, though I must own that I had
very good luck. It was three or four months since I&#8217;d
touched a card, and there&#8217;s a risk of reaction in too
drastic reform. Anyhow, I&#8217;m glad I saw that game;
one fellow had a way of handling trumps that almost
took me in. If I can remember, it should come in useful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle made no comment; restraint, he thought, was
likely to prove more effective if it were not continually
exercised. They started and for several hours plodded
up the white highway of the river, leaving it only for
a while when the ice grew fissured where the current ran
more swiftly. White hills rose above them, relieved
here and there by a somber clump of cedars or leafless
willows and birches in a ravine. The snow crunched
beneath their feet, and scattered in a fine white powder
when they broke the crust; more of it fell at intervals,
but blew away again; and they held on with a nipping
wind in their faces and a low gray sky hanging over
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>Lisle, however, noticed little; he pushed forward
with a steady and apparently tireless stride, thinking
bitterly. Since his return to Canada, his mind had
dwelt more or less continuously on Millicent. He
recognized that in leaving her with his regard for her
undeclared he had been sustained by the possibility
that he might by determined effort achieve such a success
as would enable him to return and in claiming her
to offer most of the amenities of life to which she had
been accustomed. Though it had not been easy, he had
to some extent accomplished this. On reaching Victoria,
he had found his business associates considering
one or two bold and risky schemes for the extension of
their mining interests, which he had carried out in the
face of many difficulties. The new claims he had taken
over promised a favorable yield upon development; he
had arranged for the more profitable working of others
by the aid of costly plant; and his affairs were generally
prospering.
</p>
<p>Then, when he was satisfied with the result of his
exertions, Crestwick&#8217;s news had struck him a crushing
blow. He was wholly unprepared for it. Nasmyth
had spoken of a match between Millicent and Gladwyne
as probable, but the latter had devoted himself to Bella,
who had openly encouraged him. The change in the
girl&#8217;s demeanor had escaped Lisle&#8217;s notice, because he
had been kept indoors by his injury. Now the success
he had attained counted for almost nothing; he had
nobody to share it with.
</p>
<p>The subject, however, had another aspect; he could
have borne the shock better had Millicent yielded to a
worthy suitor, but it was unthinkable that she should
marry Gladwyne. She must be saved from that at any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
cost, though he thought her restored liberty would
promise nothing to him. Even if her attachment to
Gladwyne were free from passion, as Nasmyth had
hinted, she must cherish some degree of affection and
regard for the man. His desertion of her brother
could not be forgiven, but the revelation of his baseness
would not incline her favorably toward the person
who made it, as it would seem to be merely for the purpose
of separating her from him.
</p>
<p>Lisle set his lips as he looked back on what he now
considered his weakness in withholding the story of
Gladwyne&#8217;s treachery. Had he declared it at the beginning,
Mrs. Gladwyne would have suffered no more
than she must do, and it would have saved Millicent
and himself from the pain that must fall upon them.
He bitterly regretted that he had, for once, departed
from his usual habit of simply and resolutely carrying
out an obvious task without counting the cost. Still,
he could write to Nasmyth, and to do that he must
reach the Hudson Bay post on the morrow. He
trudged on over the snow at a pace that kept Crestwick
breathless.
</p>
<p>The bitter wind chilled them through in spite of
their exertion, and it had increased by noon, when
Lisle halted for a minute or two to look about him.
</p>
<p>They were in the bottom of a valley walled in by
barren hills; the bank of the frozen river was marked
out by snow-covered stones, but none of them was large
enough to rest behind, and one could not face the wind,
motionless, in the open. While he stood, a stinging icy
powder lashed his cheeks, and his hands grew stiff in
their mittens.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not even a gulch we could sit down in,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to go on; and I&#8217;m not sorry, for
one reason. There&#8217;s not much time to spare.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick&#8217;s eyes were smarting from the white glare;
having started when weary from a previous journey,
his legs and shoulders ached; but he had no choice between
freezing and keeping himself slightly warm by
steady walking. It would, he knew, be harder by and
by, when his strength began to fail and the heat died
out of his exhausted body.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to find a shelter for the tent by nightfall,
or dig a snowpit where there&#8217;s some wood,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to hold out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They proceeded and the afternoon&#8217;s march tried him
severely. Aching all over, breathing hard when they
stumbled among the stones to skirt some half-frozen
rapid, he labored on, regretting the comforts he had
abandoned in England and yet not wholly sorry that
he had done so. His moral fiber was toughening, for
after all his faults were largely the result of circumstances
and environment. Of no great intelligence,
and imperfectly taught, he had been neglected by his
penurious father who had been engaged in building up
his commercial prosperity; his mother had died when
he was young.
</p>
<p>One of his marked failings was an inability to estimate
the true value of things. He possessed something
of the spirit of adventure and a desire to escape from
the drab monotony of his early life, but these found
expression in betting on the exploits of others on the
football field and the turf, a haunting of the music-halls,
and the cultivation of acquaintances on the lowest
rung of the dramatic profession. All this offered him
some glimpses of what he did not then perceive was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
merely sham romance. Later when, on the death of
his father, wealth had opened a wider field, deceived by
surface appearances, he had made the same mistake,
selecting wrong models and then chiefly copying their
failings. Even his rather generous enthusiasm for
those whom he admired had led him farther into error.
</p>
<p>Now, however, his eyes had been partly opened.
Thrown among men who pretended nothing, in a land
where pretense is generally useless, he was learning to
depreciate much that he had admired. Called upon to
make the true adventure he had blindly sought for, he
found that little counted except the elemental qualities
of courage and steadfastness. Dear life was the stake
in this game, and the prizes were greater things than
a repute for cheap gallantry, and pieces of money;
they were the subjugation of rock and river, the conversion
of the wilderness to the use of man. Crestwick
was growing in the light he gained, and in proof of it
he stumbled forward, scourged by driving snow,
throughout the bitter afternoon, although before the
end of it he could scarcely lift his weary feet.
</p>
<p>It was getting dark, when they found a few cedars
clustered in the shelter of a crag, and Lisle set to work
hewing off the lower branches and cutting knots of the
resinous wood. Crestwick could not rouse himself to
assist, and when the fire was kindled he lay beside it,
shivering miserably.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the kettle to be filled,&#8221; suggested Lisle.
&#8220;You could break the ice where the stream&#8217;s faster
among those stones; we&#8217;d boil water quicker than we&#8217;d
melt down snow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick got up with an effort that cost him a good
deal and stumbled away from the fire. Then a gust of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
wind met him, enveloping him in snow-dust and taking
the power of motion momentarily away. He shook
beneath his furs in the biting cold. Still, the river was
near, and he moved on another few yards, when the
kettle slipped from his stiffened hands and rolled down
a steep slope. He stopped, wondering stupidly whether
he could get down to recover it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind; come back!&#8221; Lisle called to him.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go for the thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad turned at the summons and sank down again
beside the fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m done,&#8221; he said wearily. &#8220;I may feel
a little more fit in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle filled the kettle and prepared supper, and after
eating voraciously, Crestwick lay down in the tent. It
was in comparative shelter, but the frost grew more
severe and the icy wind, eddying in behind the rock,
threatened to overturn the frail structure every now
and then. He tried to smoke, but found no comfort in
it after he had with difficulty lighted his pipe; he did
not feel inclined to talk, and it was a relief to him
when Lisle sank into slumber.
</p>
<p>Crestwick long remembered that night. His feet
and hands tingled painfully with the cold, the branches
he lay upon found out the sorest parts of his aching
body, and he would have risen and walked up and down
in the lee of the rock had he felt capable of the exertion,
but he was doubtful whether he could even get
upon his feet. At times thick smoke crept into the
tent, and though it set him to coughing it was really a
welcome change in his distressing sensations. He was
utterly exhausted, but he shivered too much to sleep.
</p>
<p>At last, a little while before daybreak, Lisle got up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
and strode away to the river after stirring the fire, and
then, most cruel thing of all, the lad became sensible
of a soothing drowsiness when it was too late for him
to indulge in it. For a few moments he struggled
hard, and then blissfully yielded. He was awakened
by his companion, who was shaking him as he laid a
plate and pannikin at his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be off in a few minutes,&#8221; he announced.
</p>
<p>Crestwick raised himself with one hand and blinked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I can manage it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; responded Lisle, hiding his compassion,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll have to decide which of two things you&#8217;ll do&mdash;you
can stay here until I come back, or you can take
the trail with me. I must go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick shrank from the painful choice. He did
not think that he could walk; but to prolong the experience
of the previous night for another twenty-four
hours or more seemed even worse. He ate his breakfast;
and then with a tense effort he got upon his feet
and slipped the straps of the pack over his shoulders.
Moving unevenly, he set off, lest he should yield to his
weariness and sink down again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he called back to Lisle.
</p>
<p>He sometimes wondered afterward how he endured
throughout the day. He was half dazed; he blundered
forward, numbed in body, with his mind too dulled to
be conscious of more than a despairing dejection. As
he scarcely expected to reach the post, it did not matter
how soon he fell. Yet, by instinctive effort stronger
than conscious volition, the struggle for life continued;
and Lisle&#8217;s keen anxiety concerning him diminished as
the hours went by. Every step brought them nearer
warmth and shelter, and made it more possible that help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
could be obtained if the lad collapsed. That was the
only course that would be available because they were
now crossing a lofty wind-swept elevation bare of timber.
</p>
<p>It was afternoon when they entered a long valley,
and Lisle, grasping Crestwick&#8217;s arm, partly supported
him as they stumbled down the steep descent. Stunted
trees straggled up toward them as they pushed on
down the hollow, and Lisle surmised that the journey
was almost over. That was fortunate, for he had some
trouble in keeping his companion upon his feet. At
length a faint howl rose from ahead and Lisle stopped
and listened intently. The sound was repeated more
plainly, and was followed by a confused snarling, the
clamor of quarreling dogs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Malamutes; the freighters can&#8217;t have started yet
with their sledges,&#8221; he said to Crestwick, who was holding
on to him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they can be more than
half a mile off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll manage that somehow,&#8221; replied the lad.
</p>
<p>They went on through thickening timber, until at
last a log house came into sight. In front of it stood
two sledges, and a pack of snapping, snarling dogs
were scuffling in the snow. Lisle was devoutly thankful
when he opened the door and helped the lad into a
log-walled room where four men, two of whom wore
furs, were talking. The air was dry and strongly
heated, besides being heavy with tobacco smoke and
Crestwick sank limply into a chair. Gasping hard, he
leaned forward, as if unable to hold himself upright;
but Lisle was not alarmed: he had suffered at times,
when exhausted, from the reaction that follows the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
change from the bitter cold outside to the stuffiness of
a stove-heated room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Played out; I&#8217;d some trouble to get him along,&#8221; he
explained to the men. &#8220;We&#8217;re going on to the claims
at the gulch to-morrow.&#8221; Then he addressed the two
in furs: &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll take me out a letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course; but you&#8217;ll have to hustle,&#8221; said
one of them, and Lisle turned to a man in a deerskin
jacket whom he took for the agent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you give me some paper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Sit down right here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not easy to write with stiffened fingers or to
collect his thoughts with his head swimming from the
change of temperature, but he informed Nasmyth
briefly of what he had heard and asked how much truth
there was in it. He added that he would have started
for England forthwith, only that he could not be sure
that this was necessary, and to leave his work unfinished
might jeopardize the interests of people who had staked
a good deal of money on the success of his schemes.
Nevertheless he would come at once, if Nasmyth considered
the match likely to be brought about and
would cable him at Victoria, from whence a message
would reach him. In the meanwhile, Nasmyth could
make such use of their knowledge of Gladwyne&#8217;s treachery
as he thought judicious.
</p>
<p>Shortly after he had written the letter the two men
in furs set out, and when the sound of their departure
had died away the agent addressed his guests.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix you some supper; you look as if you needed
it. Rustle round, Larry, and get the frying-pan on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They ate an excellent meal and shortly afterward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
Crestwick crawled into a wooden bunk, where he reveled
in the unusual warmth and the softness of a mattress
filled with swamp-hay. He had never lain down to rest
in England with the delicious sense of physical comfort
that now crept over his worn-out body.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>MILLICENT SUMMONS HER GUIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>Lisle was living luxuriously in Victoria when
Nasmyth&#8217;s answer reached him by mail.
Though it was still winter among the ranges
of the North, the seaboard city had been bathed in
clear sunshine and swept by mild west winds during the
past few days, and after the bitter frost and driving
snow Lisle rejoiced in the genial warmth and brightness.
There are few more finely situated cities than
Victoria, with its views across the strait of the white
heights of Mount Baker and the Olympians on the
American shore, even in the Pacific Province where
the environment of all is beautiful.
</p>
<p>Lisle was sitting in the hotel lounge after dinner
when three English letters were handed to him. The
sight of them affected him curiously, and leaning back
in his chair he glanced round the room. Like the rest
of the great building in which he had his quarters, it
was sumptuously furnished, but everything was aggressively
new. There was, he felt, little that suggested
fixity of tenure and continuity in the West; the
times changed too rapidly, people came and went, alert,
feverishly bustling, optimistic. In the old land, his
friends among the favored few dwelt with marked English
calm in homes that had apparently been built to
stand forever. Yet he was Western, by deliberate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
choice as well as by birth; while there was much to be
said for the other life which had its seductive charm,
the strenuous, eager one that he led was better.
</p>
<p>He opened the letters&mdash;one from Bella, announcing
her engagement and inquiring about her brother; a
second from Millicent, stating that it was decided that
she would visit British Columbia in the early summer;
and a third from Nasmyth, which, dreading its contents,
he kept to the last.
</p>
<p>He was, however, slightly reassured when he opened
it. Nasmyth&#8217;s remarks were brief but clear enough.
There was no actual engagement between Millicent and
Clarence, though Mrs. Gladwyne was doing her utmost
to bring one about and Millicent saw the man
frequently. In the meanwhile, he did not think there
was anything to be done; Lisle could not conclusively
prove his story, though he could make a disastrous sensation,
which was to be avoided, and it would be wiser to
defer the disclosure until the engagement should actually
be announced. Millicent&#8217;s attachment to Clarence
was not likely to grow very much stronger in a month or
two. In conclusion, he urged Lisle to wait.
</p>
<p>On the whole, Lisle agreed with him. Somehow
he felt that Millicent would never marry Gladwyne.
Apart from his interference, he thought that her instincts
would, even at the last moment, cause her to
recoil from the match. Furthermore, turning to another
aspect of the matter, he could not clear his dead
comrade&#8217;s memory by telling a tale that was founded
merely on probabilities. There was nothing for it
but to await events, though he was still determined to
start for England the moment Nasmyth&#8217;s letter made
this seem advisable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>Shortly afterward, one of his business associates
came in: a young man with a breezy, restless manner
who would not have been trusted in England with the
responsibilities he most efficiently discharged. In the
West, a staid and imposing air carries no great weight
with it and eagerness and even rather unguided activity
are seldom accounted drawbacks. There dulness
is dreaded more than rashness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen Walthew and Slyde,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;It will be all right about the money; we&#8217;ll put the
hydraulic plant proposition through at the next Board
meeting. You&#8217;ll have to go back right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only just come down; the frost&#8217;s not out of
me yet,&#8221; Lisle grumbled. &#8220;Besides, you seem to be
going ahead rather fast here in the city. Walthew&#8217;s
a little too much of a hustler; I&#8217;d rather he&#8217;d stop to
think. You&#8217;re almost as bad, Garnet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young man laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you can&#8217;t help it, it&#8217;s the English streak in
you; but in a way you&#8217;re right. Fact is Walthew and
I have hustled the rest of the crowd most off their
feet, and we mean to keep them on the jump. Last
meeting old Macalan&#8217;s eyes were bulging with horror,
he could hardly stammer out his indignation&mdash;said
our extravagance was sinful. Anyway, you&#8217;ve got to
go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle made an acquiescent grimace. His face was
strongly darkened by exposure to the frost and the
glare of the snow; his hands were scarred, with several
ugly recently-healed wounds on them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he complied with some reluctance, &#8220;if it&#8217;s
necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; Garnet explained. &#8220;Think we&#8217;re going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
have washing plant worth a good many thousand dollars
left lying in the bush or dropped into rivers?
You&#8217;ll have to arrange for transport and break new
trails. You can do it best when the snow&#8217;s still on
the ground, and that plant must start working soon
after the thaw comes. We&#8217;ve got to justify our expenditure
while the season&#8217;s open.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got your authority to buy the plant
yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Garnet chuckled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was ordered, provisionally, the day you came
down; the makers are only waiting for a wire from
the Board meeting. In fact, I shouldn&#8217;t be astonished
if some of the work isn&#8217;t in progress now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle was quick of thought and prompt in action,
but he sometimes felt as if Garnet took his breath
away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have it all arranged, I may as well agree,&#8221;
he laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take Crestwick back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That reminds me; he said something about taking
an interest&mdash;asked if I could get him shares at a
moderate premium, though he owned that his trustees
might make trouble about letting him have the money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not to have them!&#8221; Lisle replied emphatically.
&#8220;What&#8217;s more, the trustees won&#8217;t part with a
dollar unless I guarantee the project&mdash;I&#8217;ve been in
communication with them. Rest assured that the idea
won&#8217;t get my endorsement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could never get at the workings of the English
mind,&#8221; Garnet declared. &#8220;Now if my relatives had
any money, I&#8217;d rush them all in. This is the safest
and best-managed mining proposition on the Pacific
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
Slope. What kind of morality is it that gathers in
the general investor and keeps your friends out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; it doesn&#8217;t concern the point. I&#8217;m
actuated by what you may call a prejudice. You
can&#8217;t remove it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Garnet responded good-humoredly, &#8220;it&#8217;s
a pretty tough country up yonder and I suppose the
lad&#8217;s of some service. You&#8217;re saving us a pile of
money in experts&#8217; fees and I don&#8217;t see why you
shouldn&#8217;t put him on the company&#8217;s payroll. I mentioned
the thing to Walthew; he was agreeable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They talked about other matters and presently
Crestwick came in, smartly dressed and looking remarkably
vigorous and clear-skinned. There were
many points of difference between his appearance now
and when Lisle had first met him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Garnet has a proposition to make,&#8221; Lisle informed
him; and the Canadian briefly stated it.
</p>
<p>Crestwick did not seem surprised, nor did he display
much appreciation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, I thought you might have mentioned
the matter before,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Still, if
you want my services, you&#8217;ll have to go up twenty
dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A week?&#8221; Garnet asked ironically. &#8220;You promise
well; if you stay here a year or two you&#8217;ll make
a useful and enterprising citizen. We could get an
experienced boss packer for what I offered you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Down here, yes. When he got to where the claims
are, he&#8217;d almost certainly drop you and turn miner,
and you couldn&#8217;t blame him. A man deserves a hundred
dollars a day merely for living up yonder. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
it&#8217;s a month I was speaking of. If you want me, you&#8217;ll
have to come up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Garnet laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I can fix it; but we&#8217;ll get our value out
of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a compliment, if you look at it in one
way,&#8221; Crestwick grinned in reply.
</p>
<p>When Garnet had left them, he turned to Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks awfully. Of course, it was your idea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Garnet suggested the thing; that&#8217;s more flattering,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick looked at him, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not to be played so easily as I was when I
first met you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of course, in a sense, the
pay&#8217;s no great inducement to me; it&#8217;s the idea of being
offered it. I&#8217;m going to advise old Barnes, my
trustee; he was fond of saying that I was fortunate
in being left well off because I&#8217;d never earn sixpence
as long as I lived, until I stopped the thing by offering
him ten to one I&#8217;d go out and make it in a couple
of hours by carrying somebody&#8217;s bag from the station.
Anyhow, this is the first move.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re going farther?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; was the cheerful answer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be a
director of this company before I&#8217;ve finished. You
can&#8217;t stop my buying shares when I come into my
property.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle was conscious of some relief. It was a laudable
ambition and Crestwick promised to be much less
of a responsibility than he had once anticipated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a letter from Bella,&#8221; Lisle told him. &#8220;She
still desires to be informed if you&#8217;re getting along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
satisfactorily. I think I can tell her there&#8217;s no cause
for uneasiness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bella&#8217;s a good sort,&#8221; returned Crestwick. &#8220;She&#8217;ll
stop asking such questions by and by. At least, I
think she&#8217;ll have some grounds for doing so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went out into the city and a week afterward
they sailed together for the North. It was still winter
in the wilds, and though that made Lisle&#8217;s work a
little easier, because rivers and lakes and muskegs
were frozen, he found it sufficiently arduous. He had
to survey and break new trails suitable for the conveyance
of heavy machinery, up rugged valleys and over
high divides, and to arrange for transport&mdash;canoes
here, a log-bridge there, relays of packers farther on.
No man&#8217;s efforts could be wasted, for time was precious
and wages are high in the wilderness. Then, when at
last the frost relaxed its grip and rock and snow and
loosened soil came thundering down the gullies in huge
masses, the work grew more difficult as he began to
build a dam.
</p>
<p>Some of the men sent up to him, artizans from the
cities, sailor deserters, dismayed by the toils of the
journey and the nature of their tasks, promptly
mutinied on arrival. Others dispatched after them
failed to turn up, and Lisle never discovered what became
of them. The camp-site was a sea of puddled
mire with big stones in it; tents and shacks were almost
continuously dripping; and every hollow was
filled with a raging torrent. Nobody had dry clothes,
even to sleep in; the work was mostly carried on knee-deep
in water, and at first things got little better as
the days grew warmer. The hill-benches steamed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
clammy mists wrapped the camp at night; the downward
rush of melting snow increased, and several times
wild floods swept away portions of the dam and half-built
flume.
</p>
<p>In spite of it all, the work went on: foot by foot the
wall of pile-bound rock rose and the long wooden
conduit curved away down the valley; and when at
length the hydraulic plant began to arrive, piecemeal,
Lisle found Crestwick eminently useful. He superintended
the transport, patrolling the trails and keeping
them repaired. His skill with shovel and ax was
negligible, but he could send a man or two to mend
the gap where the path had slipped away down some
gully or to fling a couple of logs across a swollen
creek that could not be forded. He got thinner and
harder from constant toil and from sleeping, often
scantily fed, unsheltered in the rain.
</p>
<p>After a while, however, there was a pleasant change:
the days grew hot, the nights were clear and cold,
and the short, vivid summer broke suddenly upon the
mountain land. Then it seldom rained, as the high
seaward barrier condensed most of the Pacific moisture,
but at times the clouds which crossed the summits
unbroken descended in a copious deluge, and it was in
the midst of such a downpour that Crestwick returned
to camp one evening after a week&#8217;s absence on the
trail. His dripping garments were ragged, his boots
gaped open, and his soft felt hat had fallen shapeless
about his head. He found Lisle in a similar guise
sitting at his evening meal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they got the pipes and those large castings
across the big ravine?&#8221; Lisle asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that has been done,&#8221; Crestwick answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
&#8220;By the way, one of the packers told me that the
man who&#8217;s coming up to run the plant&mdash;Carsley, isn&#8217;t
it?&mdash;has arrived. There were some fittings or something
wrong and he stopped behind to investigate, but
the packer seemed to think he&#8217;d get through soon
after I did. That turns us loose, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say I could hand things over to him in
about a week,&#8221; replied Lisle. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll clear out.
I suppose you won&#8217;t be sorry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick stretched out his feet to display his
broken boots and rent trousers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;since I left here, I&#8217;ve spent a
good deal of my time in an icy creek, and it&#8217;s nearly
a week since I had any sleep worth speaking of. We
had to make a bridge for the freighters to bring those
castings over and we&#8217;d no end of trouble to get the
stringers fixed&mdash;the stream was strong and we had to
build a pier in it. Not long ago, I&#8217;d have considered
anybody who did this kind of thing without compulsion
mad, but in some mysterious way it grows on
you. I don&#8217;t pretend to explain it, but it won&#8217;t be
with unmixed delight that I&#8217;ll go back to the city.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused and fumbled in his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was forgetting your mail. I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s rather
pulpy, but I couldn&#8217;t help that. By the way, I&#8217;d a
letter from Bella, written at the Frontenac, Quebec.
She&#8217;s brought Carew out; they&#8217;re going to Glacier
very soon, and she still intends to look me up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle opened the letters handed him and managed
to read them, though their condition fully bore out
Crestwick&#8217;s description. Two or three were on business
matters, but there was one from Millicent, and
he started at the first few lines.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Gladwyne and Miss Hume have sailed&mdash;they
must have landed a week ago,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;She
wants to go over the ground her brother traversed&mdash;you
have heard of that project. Nasmyth sailed a
week earlier to arrange matters at this end; but I don&#8217;t
know how Miss Hume will get along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s merely a question of transport,&#8221; asserted
Crestwick with the air of an authority on the subject.
&#8220;So long as you provide sufficient packers, with relays
from supply bases, you can travel in comparative
comfort, though it&#8217;s expensive.&#8221; Then an idea occurred
to him. &#8220;They&#8217;re pretty sure to run across
Bella; Miss Gladwyne knows Carew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle sat silent a few minutes, conscious of a strong
satisfaction. Millicent was in Canada, and there was
no mention of Gladwyne! Then it struck him as curious
that Bella should have come over at the same time.
As Millicent knew Carew, it was very probable that
Bella would insist on joining the expedition, which
Millicent might agree to, if, as seemed likely, her
rather elderly companion had to be left behind.
Nasmyth had, no doubt, already reached British
Columbia; and it looked as if those indirectly brought
together by George Gladwyne&#8217;s tragic death would be
reunited at the scene of it. This was, Lisle reflected,
merely the result of a natural sequence of events, but
there was for all that something strangely significant
about it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it has been arranged that I&#8217;m to
act as guide, and Miss Gladwyne says they&#8217;ll wait for
me. As that&#8217;s the case, I don&#8217;t see why I shouldn&#8217;t
start as soon as Carsley gets through. I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if he brings a letter from Nasmyth. It will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
a tough journey, and I&#8217;ll have to break a new trail.
Are you coming, or will you head for Vancouver to
join Bella?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stick together,&#8221; replied the lad. &#8220;Bella&#8217;s
to stay over here some months, and if she decides to
join Miss Gladwyne she&#8217;ll leave Glacier long before I
could reach the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle rose and shook out his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he responded, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take a look around, and
you had better start off the first thing to-morrow and
hurry those castings on. There&#8217;s a good deal to be
done if we&#8217;re to get away when Carsley turns up.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>A RELIABLE MAN</h3>
</div>

<p>The sun had just dipped behind a black ridge
of hills, and the lake lay still, mirroring the
tall cedars on its farther shore. A faint chill
was creeping into the mountain air, which was scented
with resinous smoke, and somewhere across the water
a loon was calling. A cluster of tents stood upon the
shingle, and in front of the largest Millicent reclined
in a camp-chair. Near her Miss Hume sat industriously
embroidering; and Nasmyth lay upon the
stones. Bella occupied another camp-chair, a young
man with a pleasant brown face sitting at her feet;
and farther along the beach a group of packers in blue
shirts and duck trousers lay smoking about a fire. By
and by one rose and when he began to hack at a drift-log
the sharp thudding of his ax startled the loon
which departed with a peal of shrieking laughter.
</p>
<p>The party had reached the fringe of the wilderness
after a long stage journey from the railroad through
a rugged country. They had met with no mishaps
beyond a delay in the transport of some of their baggage,
and everything had been made comparatively
easy for them; but they knew that henceforward there
might be a difference. Man must depend largely upon
his own natural resources in the wilds, where, after
furnishing the traveler with the best equipment and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
packers to carry it, the power of wealth is strictly
limited. A recognition of the fact hovered more or
less darkly in all their minds, but Millicent was the
first to hint at it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far we have had absolutely nothing to complain
of except a little jolting in the stage,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
beginning to understand why adventurous sight-seers
are coming out here&mdash;it&#8217;s a glorious country!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my duty to point out that it won&#8217;t be quite
the same as we go on,&#8221; Nasmyth remarked. &#8220;What
do you say, Carew?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter; he&#8217;s said it all before,&#8221; Bella
broke in. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had to listen to appalling accounts
of his previous adventures in Canada, which were, no
doubt, meant to deter me; but the reality is that the
hotels at Banff and Glacier are remarkably comfortable,
and I haven&#8217;t the least fault to find with this
camp. We ought to be grateful to Millicent for letting
us come, and though Arthur hinted that it would
be a rather sociable honeymoon, I said that was a
safeguard. One&#8217;s illusions might get sooner shattered
in a more conventional one.&#8221; She stooped and
ruffled her husband&#8217;s hair. &#8220;Still, he hasn&#8217;t deteriorated
very much on closer acquaintance, and perhaps
I&#8217;m fortunate in this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent sat silent for a few moments. She knew,
to her sorrow, one man who did not improve the more
one saw of him, and that was the man she had tacitly
agreed to marry. She could not tell why she had
done so&mdash;she had somehow drifted into it. Interest,
family associations, a feeling that could best be described
as liking, even pity, had played their part in
influencing her, and now she realized that she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
not honorably draw back when he formally claimed
her. She laughed as one of the packers who had a
good voice broke into a song.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the climax; it needs only the cockney accent
to make the thing complete,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When
I was last in London, one heard that silly jingle everywhere.
I suppose it&#8217;s a triumph of the music-halls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or of modern civilization&mdash;a rendering of distance
of no account,&#8221; suggested Carew. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
good deal to be said for the latter achievement, as we
are discovering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Distance,&#8221; declared Bella, &#8220;still counts for something
here. I&#8217;ve been thinking about Jim all day;
imagining him dragging his canoe through the timber
beyond those hills, and wondering whether he&#8217;d find
us when he got to the other side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has been doing more,&#8221; her husband broke
in. &#8220;Though she hasn&#8217;t confessed it, she has been
looking out for him ever since this morning. In fact,
I discovered that our cook is keeping a supper ready
that would satisfy four or five men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella turned to Millicent with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think the meal will be wasted?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I can hardly believe it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark the assurance of that answer,&#8221; commented
Carew. &#8220;A man couldn&#8217;t feel it; it&#8217;s irrational.
Miss Gladwyne speaks with a certainty that our guide
will come, though she has nothing to base her calculations
on&mdash;she doesn&#8217;t know the distance or the difficulties
of the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that matter?&#8221; Bella retorted. &#8220;She
knows the man.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>Carew made a grimace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman&#8217;s reasoning. As we&#8217;ve nothing better to
do, I&#8217;ll try to show the absurdity of it. A man, so
far as he concerns this discussion, consists of a certain
quantity of bones, with muscles and tendons capable
of setting them in motion&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; Bella warned him. &#8220;It&#8217;s safer to
avoid these details. Besides, you&#8217;re leaving something
out; I don&#8217;t mean the nerve-cells, but the inner personality,
whatever it is, that commands them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to show that, as a mechanical structure,
he is capable of moving his own weight and so much
extra a limited distance in a given time, so long as
he can secure the necessary food and sleep. Neither
the weight nor the distance can be increased except
by an effort which, if continued, will soon reduce them
below their former level.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that&#8217;s how you reason&mdash;mechanically.
We&#8217;re different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take quite another line,&#8221; Nasmyth interposed.
&#8220;Lisle&#8217;s traversing a country new to him; he can&#8217;t
tell what rapids, ranges, or thick timber may cause
delay. No amount of determination will enable one,
for instance, to knock more than a few minutes off
the time needed to carry a canoe round a portage, nor
by any effort can one cross a range as quickly as one
can walk up a valley. Isn&#8217;t that clear, Millicent?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a smile in the girl&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but, all the same, Lisle&#8217;s supper&#8217;s
waiting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Such confidence makes one jealous,&#8221; grumbled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
Carew. &#8220;Lisle, whom I haven&#8217;t met, is evidently a
man who keeps his promise. That means a good
deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A very great deal,&#8221; Bella assured him. &#8220;Since
one&#8217;s bound to meet with difficulties one can&#8217;t foresee,
it proves that one man has resource, resolution, and
many other eminently useful qualities; but all this is
getting too serious. I&#8217;d better point out that Lisle
hasn&#8217;t even promised to meet us here at any particular
time.&#8221; She paused and laughed mischievously.
&#8220;Millicent merely sent for him, mentioning to-morrow
as the day she would like to start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little color crept into Millicent&#8217;s face, but Bella
went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;She called and I haven&#8217;t the least doubt that our
guide set out, over ranges, up rapids, across wide lakes.
One can&#8217;t imagine that man taking it easily, and
there&#8217;s the obvious fact that Jim will have to keep up
with him. He will find it hard, but I dare say it will
do him good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed and strolled away with Carew.
The sunset green grew dimmer behind the hills and a
pale half-moon appeared above the shadowy woods.
It was very still, except for the lapping of the water
upon the stones.
</p>
<p>Bella leaned back lazily in her chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is delightful,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
Clarence want to come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The unexpectedness of the question startled Millicent
into answering:
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Then you didn&#8217;t tell him? Why didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>It was difficult to reply, but there was something in
Bella&#8217;s voice that disarmed Millicent&#8217;s resentment.
Bella had grown gentler since her marriage and less
often indulged in bitterness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Millicent, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want any one
to distract me; I&#8217;m going to make photographs and
sketches for the book, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you let us come!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Millicent; &#8220;you&#8217;re different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. We won&#8217;t disturb you; and Nasmyth
wouldn&#8217;t count. He&#8217;s an unobtrusive person, only to
the front when he is wanted, which is a good deal to
say for him; he doesn&#8217;t expect anything. No doubt,
the same applies to Lisle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent made no answer and Bella wondered
whether she had gone too far.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t Clarence hear that you were going?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was in Switzerland with his mother. She had
been recommended to try a change.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella asked no more questions and Millicent sat
wondering how far she had been influenced by the
reason she had given for leaving Clarence behind.
She had undoubtedly desired to be free to devote herself
to the gathering of material for her book, but that
was not quite all. She had also half-consciously
shrunk from the close contact with Clarence which
would have been one result of their life in camp, but
this she refused to admit. It was clearer that she desired
an extension of the liberty which she must sometime
relinquish. Taking it all round, she was rather
troubled in mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing,&#8221; remarked Bella. &#8220;He can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
write you any reproachful letters for stealing away.
At least, if he does so, you won&#8217;t get them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This, as Millicent recognized, was a relief, but Miss
Hume broke in upon her reflections with some trifling
request and soon afterward the men strolled back toward
the fire. The packers had already gone to sleep;
the dew was heavy, but Nasmyth lay down on the
shingle and Carew took a place beside his wife&#8217;s chair.
Suddenly Millicent leaned forward with her face turned
toward the lake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; she cried sharply. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you hear
something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>No sound reached the others for a moment; and then
Nasmyth jumped up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;canoe paddles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A measured beat stole out of the silence, increasing
until it broke sharply through the tranquil lapping of
the water. Then, far up the glittering lake, a dim
black bar crept out into the moonlight and by degrees
grew plainer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, they may be Indians,&#8221; Bella suggested
mischievously.
</p>
<p>Carew included Millicent in his answering bow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I believe I&#8217;m beaten. You and Miss Gladwyne
were right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The moonlight was on Millicent&#8217;s face, and Bella,
watching her, read something that roused her interest
in its expression&mdash;it was stronger than satisfaction,
a deeper feeling not unmixed with pride. She had
called and the man she had summoned from the depths
of the wilderness had responded.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later the canoe grounded noisily on
the shingle and Crestwick leaped out; Bella, regardless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
of the others, flung her arms about his neck and kissed
him; and then she held him off so that she might see
him. His garments were rent and tattered, his face
was very lean, and one of his hands was bleeding from
continuous labor with the paddle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;you disreputable scarecrow!
You&#8217;re not fit for select society. And how long is it
since you had anything to eat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a rather rough time getting through; there
was thick scrub timber in some of the valleys,&#8221; Crestwick
explained. &#8220;We might have made things easier
by spending another few days on the trail, but Lisle
wouldn&#8217;t listen when I suggested it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you did suggest it,&#8221; said Bella reproachfully.
&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m merely your sister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want a better one,&#8221; Crestwick rejoined,
grinning. &#8220;It strikes me you&#8217;re looking prettier than
you did; but that&#8217;s perhaps because you have taken to
wearing more ladylike clothes. As regards my appearance,
I&#8217;ll venture to say that yours will be very
much the same before you&#8217;ve finished this journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle had walked toward Miss Hume and had shaken
hands with her before he turned to Millicent. That
pleased the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ran it rather close, but the day isn&#8217;t quite
finished yet,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;We had some little
trouble once or twice which prevented our turning up
earlier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent smiled in a manner that sent a thrill
through him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only say that we kept your supper; but
that&#8217;s significant, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Then she called to
Nasmyth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will you see if the cook&#8217;s awake?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had no opportunity for saying anything further,
for Carew came up with Bella, who was voluble, and
some time later Lisle and Crestwick sat down to a
bountiful meal, while Millicent and Bella waited on
them. Lisle was slightly embarrassed by their ministrations,
but Crestwick openly enjoyed them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put the plate where I can reach it easily,&#8221; he bade
his sister. &#8220;Look how you have placed that cup; if
I move, it will spill!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have more courage than I have, Jim,&#8221; Carew
remarked with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve needed it,&#8221; the lad declared. &#8220;I&#8217;ve borne
enough from Bella in my time. She&#8217;ll no doubt say
that I deserved it, and there may be some ground for
the notion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the meal was finished they all gathered round
the replenished fire, Lisle lying back in the shadow
because of the state of his clothes. With the exception
of Jim, the others were dressed much as they had
been at home; their conversation was light and easy,
and their manner tranquil. If he could have blotted
out the background of tall straight trunks and
shadowy rocks, he could have imagined that they were
lounging on a sheltered English lawn. Double-skinned
tents, camp-chairs, and other signs of a regard for
physical comfort bore out the idea in his mind.
These English people with their quiet confidence that
what they needed&mdash;and that was a good deal&mdash;would,
as had always happened, somehow be supplied, were at
once exasperating and admirable. They were the
same everywhere, unmoved by change, claiming all that
was choicest as by right, and very much at ease on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
the fringe of the wilderness. They did not belong to
it; one could have imagined that it belonged to them.
Their journey, however, had only begun, and there
were alterations that must obviously be made on the
morrow.
</p>
<p>Then Lisle yielded to a strong sense of satisfaction.
For the next month or two he would be almost constantly
in Millicent&#8217;s company; her companions were
his friends, and he thought that he would not be
troubled by Gladwyne&#8217;s presence. Desiring to assure
himself on the latter point, he turned to Bella.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody has mentioned Clarence. I was wondering
if he would join us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, smiling at him meaningly;
&#8220;he wasn&#8217;t invited.&#8221; Then she moved away, leaving
Lisle more deeply content.
</p>
<p>Presently the party broke up, and when they reached
the tent they jointly occupied, Miss Hume remarked
to Millicent:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look unusually pleased, my dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say I do,&#8221; Millicent smiled. &#8220;It&#8217;s something
to feel that one&#8217;s confidence has been justified,
and perhaps rather more to rest assured that everything
will now go as smoothly as possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you mean since Mr. Lisle has come?
Apart from his practical abilities, I&#8217;m fond of that
man. No doubt you noticed that he came first to me,
as the eldest, though he is aware that I&#8217;m only a dependent.
In a way, of course, he wasn&#8217;t altogether
right, Bella Carew being married and you the actual
hostess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if such points are of any importance in
the bush,&#8221; Millicent answered, laughing. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
glad Mr. Lisle&#8217;s action won your good opinion. I
like my friends to be graceful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Hume, faded, gray-haired and formal, looked
reflective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The word you used is not quite the one I should
have chosen. Clarence Gladwyne is graceful; I think
this Canadian is something better. To-night he was
actuated by genuine chivalry. My esteem may not be
worth much, but it is his.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Moved by some impulse, Millicent kissed her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt he&#8217;d value it. But I can&#8217;t have
Clarence depreciated; and it&#8217;s getting very late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Hume noticed a slight change in the girl&#8217;s
voice as she mentioned Gladwyne. She put out the
lamp but it was some time before she went to sleep.
She loved Millicent, and she believed there was trouble
awaiting her.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>LISLE TURNS AUTOCRAT</h3>
</div>

<p>On the morning after his arrival, Lisle called
the company together and first of all addressed
Millicent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your wish that I should act as guide to this
expedition?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent answered in the affirmative and he went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The guide must be commander-in-chief, with undisputed
authority. Before we start, I must ask if
any one objects to that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They gave him full power, with acclamation, and
he nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I&#8217;d better explain that the
main difficulty attending any expedition into an almost
uninhabited region is to keep it supplied with food
and means of shelter; it&#8217;s a question of transport.
There are two ways of getting over the difficulty&mdash;by
reducing the weight, or by increasing the number
of packers; and the latter are useful only when each
man can transport more than will satisfy his personal
requirements. I think that&#8217;s clear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They assented with some curiosity mixed with a
slight uneasiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he proceeded, &#8220;I&#8217;ll exercise my authority
by asking you to lay out in front of each tent everything
you have brought with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Including our clothes?&#8221; Bella asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Assuredly,&#8221; said Crestwick. &#8220;You can put them
in a heap; it&#8217;s the quantity and not the cut that
counts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was evident that the leader&#8217;s first instructions
were received with little favor. Millicent looked dubious
and Miss Hume alarmed; but the orders were
carried out, and Lisle accompanied by Crestwick made
a tour of inspection. Stopping in front of Bella&#8217;s
and Carew&#8217;s tent, he pointed to their rather imposing
pile of baggage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two-thirds of this will have to be left behind,
though we&#8217;ll try to pick it up again. You can make
your selection.&#8221; He went on to Millicent&#8217;s and Miss
Hume&#8217;s collection. &#8220;We can&#8217;t take more than half
of this,&#8221; he informed them. Then he addressed the
company in general. &#8220;The three ladies must occupy
Miss Gladwyne&#8217;s tent, and the men Carew&#8217;s; Nasmyth&#8217;s
must be abandoned. Each man&#8217;s outfit must be cut
down to one change of clothes and his blanket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The announcement was received with open murmurs.
They had all been accustomed to every comfort with
which a high civilization could provide them; they had
already cut down their belongings to the lowest limit
at which, in their estimation, life could be made endurable;
and many of the articles they were told must
be left behind were costly and artistic. It was a
severe test of obedience and even Nasmyth, who knew
the wilderness, desiring to safeguard the women, was
not inclined to yield. Lisle had only Crestwick to support
him until Bella touched his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand fast,&#8221; she urged, somewhat to his surprise.
&#8220;If you give way an inch now, you&#8217;ll be sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle smiled and then raised his voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I must insist. Since you object, Carew,
are you willing to carry forty pounds upon your back
while you break a trail through thick timber, where we
find it needful to leave the water?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said Carew decidedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Lisle advised dryly, &#8220;you had better leave
as much as possible of the weight behind; there&#8217;s no
likelihood of our getting more packers. You have to
choose between a camp-chair or a suitcase, for example,
and your daily dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment or two they hesitated. Lisle had,
straining his new authority to the utmost, asked them
a very hard thing, for in their regard some degree of
luxury was less an accidental favor than a prescriptive
right. Then Bella took up a long garment and with a
little resolute gesture flung it from her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;is the first sacrifice to the
stern guardians of the wilds. It ought to satisfy
them, considering who made it and what it cost.&#8221;
She seized a small valise and hurled it after the dress.
&#8220;There&#8217;s the next; I&#8217;m thankful my complexion will
stand the weather.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent looked up at Lisle, indicating a small easel,
a bulky sketch-book, and a box of water-colors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are these to go?&#8221; she asked with indignant eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered gravely; &#8220;they&#8217;re the reason
for the whole expedition, and their transport is provided
for. But you&#8217;ll have to jettison something else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The selections were made and Lisle summoned one of
the packers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Roll these things up in Mr. Nasmyth&#8217;s tent,
Pete,&#8221; he bade him. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to make a cache
of them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Like burying money, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; remarked the man,
regarding the pile of sundries with a grin. &#8220;Guess
they won&#8217;t be worth much when they&#8217;re dug up again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Half an hour later, three deeply-laden canoes left
the beach; and all day the party paddled up the gleaming
lake and crept with poles going up a slow, green
river. Sunset was near when they landed and ate
supper among a clump of cedars; and after the meal
most of them, cramped with the canoe journey,
climbed the steep hill-bench or strolled away along the
shingle. Lisle was lying, smoking, beside the fire when
Millicent sauntered toward him and sat down upon a
neighboring stone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were right, of course,&#8221; she apologized. &#8220;Am
I forgiven? It was only a momentary revolt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He smiled, though his bronzed coloring deepened,
for there was an unusual gentleness in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very natural,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I had expected
more determined opposition; but I didn&#8217;t go
farther than was necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I think the others realize that now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be more convinced of it later,&#8221; he responded
with a trace of grimness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll give you any trouble; but
since you got rid of Nasmyth&#8217;s tent, where will you
and Crestwick sleep?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim and I can make a shelter of some kind; we&#8217;re
used to the bush.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done to the lad?&#8221; Millicent asked.
&#8220;I can hardly realize the change in him; he&#8217;s a different
being.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve merely given him a chance he would hardly
have had in England. The country has done the rest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
You can ask him how much advice or admonishment
he got.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t expect you to
give him advice; it&#8217;s cheap!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made no reply, and her eyes rested with quiet
approval on his rather embarrassed face. She had no
doubt that close contact with this man had had more
to do with the change in Crestwick than the influence
of the country; and then she recollected that the lad&#8217;s
degeneration had been marked and rapid while he had
taken Clarence for a model. It was a troublesome
thought and she banished it with an effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t get here without difficulty; and our
journey will keep you away from your business for
some time,&#8221; she observed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As to that, I&#8217;ve earned a little leisure; and I&#8217;ve
been looking forward to this trip ever since I left England.
Now it&#8217;s almost like being back there again,
only that in some ways it&#8217;s even better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So far as their surroundings might explain his satisfaction,
Millicent could frankly agree with him. The
black spires of the cedars, towering far above them, cut
in rigid tracery against the splendors of the sunset
sky; one stretch of the river still shone with a saffron
light; the rest, which had grown dim, flowed through
deepening shadow. Filmy mist trails streaked the
rugged hills and the hoarse clamor of a rapid quivered
in the cool air. Behind it all, there was something that
set the lonely scene apart from any other that the girl
had looked upon&mdash;one could realize that this was as
yet an untamed and unsullied region. But her companion
was accustomed to the wilderness, so there must be,
she thought, another cause for his content.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you do not grudge the time you may
have to spend with us,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grudge it!&#8221; he exclaimed; and then, restraining
himself, he broke into a soft laugh. &#8220;You may accuse
me of that feeling when you hear me grumble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The ring in his voice had its meaning and it left
her thoughtful. The revelation was not altogether
new; she had guessed his regard for her, but she imagined
that she could hold him at arm&#8217;s length if it
were necessary. It was with him as it was with
Nasmyth, and they were alike in their self-restraint.
Nasmyth had quietly accepted his dismissal when she
had shown him that it was irrevocable; and the Canadian
would not trouble her with futile complaints.
She wondered if out of three suitors she had not chosen
the least desirable in some respects; but this could
not be admitted and she resolutely thrust the idea
aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a point I&#8217;d better mention,&#8221; Lisle resumed
in a matter-of-fact tone. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to follow
the route of the first expedition from the beginning.
I&#8217;ve thought of a shorter and easier one; we&#8217;ll strike
the other by the big portage and then follow it down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you afraid of wearing out your untried followers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;I&#8217;m taking no risks that can
be avoided this journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She smilingly commended his caution, though she
was conscious of a desire, which must be held in check,
to see what he would do if he could be shaken out of
his self-control. She approved of his restraint, because
only while it was exerted could she meet him
on friendly terms; but, as had happened on his last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
afternoon in England, it piqued her. She wondered
how much it cost him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; she said with a forced laugh, &#8220;it&#8217;s
better to keep carefully clear of danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed; &#8220;but there&#8217;s now and then a
temptation to face the hazard. One feels that it&#8217;s
worth while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that. I think I&#8217;d rather enjoy the
wildness of this scene than to philosophize. Tell me
about the bear and deer we are likely to come across.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He discoursed at length, and she sat listening while
the light faded and the cedars grew blacker. Then the
others approached and they went back to camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast will be at seven prompt,&#8221; he informed
them. &#8220;The packers will strike tents while you eat,
so have everything ready. There are two awkward
portages to be tackled to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They started in a clammy mist which clung about
them until they reached the foot of the first wild rapid,
where the green and white flood came roaring over
ledges and between huge boulders, with wisps of spray
tossing over it. This was Millicent&#8217;s first sight of the
river in anger, and she watched, at first almost appalled
and then thrilled with strong excitement, when
Lisle and one packer took the leading canoe up the
lowest rush. They stood upright in the unloaded,
unstable craft, long pole in hand, guiding her with
what seemed wonderful skill across madly-whirling eddies
and through tumbling foam, while Nasmyth and
another man, floundering deep in water, assisted them
at intervals with the tracking-line. Once Nasmyth&#8217;s
companion lost his footing and disappeared, but he
rose and Millicent saw that instead of clinging to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
line for safety he loosed it, and swimming down a wild
white tumult, came dripping ashore. This, she
thought, was bracing work that made for more than
physical vigor; but she could not imagine Clarence
indulging in it. It was too elemental, too barbarous
for him. He was fond of exertion in the form of
sport, but he required somebody to saddle and lead out
his horse and to load his second gun. There was a
difference between him and those who delighted to
grapple at first hand with nature.
</p>
<p>She was astonished to see Crestwick get a heavy
flour bag upon his back and move away with it over
very rough stones, and she joined in Bella&#8217;s laugh
when Carew attempted to shoulder another and
dropped it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time he&#8217;s ever tried such a thing in
his life,&#8221; Bella remarked. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like personal
experience. You don&#8217;t realize that it isn&#8217;t easy
when you give a porter sixpence to lift your biggest
trunk at a station.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The difference is that the porter&#8217;s used to it,&#8221;
Carew, who was red-faced and breathless, pointed out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if that would apply to you before we&#8217;ve
finished,&#8221; Bella retorted. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t do anything
else, why don&#8217;t you help those men in the river?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Carew made a gesture of resignation and resolutely
plunged in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; laughed Bella, to Millicent and Miss
Hume, &#8220;is excellent discipline; after a little of it, I
believe he&#8217;ll do me credit. I can think of a few overfed
men that I&#8217;d like to put through a drastic course
of it, only in their case I&#8217;d go in the canoe and take
my heaviest luggage with me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be wise,&#8221; asserted Millicent. &#8220;When
they reached broken water they&#8217;d probably let you
go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She collected an armful of odds and ends and set
off up-stream over the portage. The men spent several
hours bringing the canoes and stores across, and
there followed some laborious poling before they
reached the second rapid, which was safely passed.
The party was quieter than usual after supper that
night. They had had their first glimpse of the strenuous
life of the wilderness and it had impressed them.
The effect passed off, however, as they pushed on day
after day without mishap. Millicent, in particular,
delighted in all she saw&mdash;the fresh green of the
birches among the somber cedars, the lonely heights
that ever surrounded them, the gleaming lakes, the
broad green flood that here and there filled the gorges
with its thunder.
</p>
<p>She suffered no discomfort she could not laugh at;
there was something that braced her in mind and body
in the mountain air; and Clarence no longer held a
leading place in her memory. She realized now that
the thought of him had hitherto occasioned her a vague
uneasiness. Indeed, she was almost glad that he was
far away; liberty was unexpectedly sweet, and though
she had a few misgivings, she meant to enjoy it while
it lasted.
</p>
<p>Then one afternoon when they were stopped by a
fall, she slipped away from the others with her sketch-book,
and wandering back through straggling bush,
climbed a rocky ridge. The ascent was steep, but by
clambering up a gully she reached the summit, and
after strolling along it she sat down to sketch the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
gorge below. The work absorbed her attention and
some time had passed when the lengthening shadows
warned her that she would better retrace her steps to
camp.
</p>
<p>It proved difficult. She could not find the gully
she had climbed up and the side of the ridge was almost
precipitous and was clothed with brushwood.
At last, however, she reached a spot from which it
seemed possible to make the descent; but after scrambling
and sliding for some distance she was suddenly
stopped by a sheer drop of several yards to a ledge.
Being agile, she might have reached the ledge by
lowering herself by her hands, but it was narrow and
slanted outwards, so that she feared to slip off in
alighting and fall over the crag below. She attempted
to climb back to the summit and found it impossible,
for the stones she seized were loose and came away
when she disturbed them. She could only stay where
she was and call for assistance, though the clamor of
the fall, ringing up the valley, almost drowned her
voice.
</p>
<p>By and by the sunlight faded off the rocks above,
the trees below grew shadowy, and Millicent began to
feel anxious and to envy the others who would, no
doubt, be sitting down to their evening meal. They
would miss her and set out in search; but they might
not reach her until it was dark, when it would be difficult
to extricate her, and she had no desire to spend
the night among the rocks. She made another determined
attempt to get up, but slid back, nearly
slipping over the edge, while her sketch-book went
clattering far below. Then she sat still, calling out
at intervals.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>The light grew dimmer, white mists began to trail
about the heights above, and Millicent was getting
cold. She was also getting angry&mdash;it looked as if
the others were too busy eating or talking to care
what had become of her; some of them ought to have
come in search. She felt a grievance against Lisle in
particular. Why she should blame him more than
Nasmyth or Carew was not very clear, except that he
was more used to the country; but she felt that he
ought to have come to her rescue. Then, fearing
that she would have to spend the night on the hillside,
she carefully crept toward a small level space near a
jutting rock and sat down, shivering, while dusk slowly
crept across the bush.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE</h3>
</div>

<p>Millicent had no intention of going to sleep
among the rocks, but after a while she grew
drowsy, and when at length she raised her head
with a start the moon hung over the hills across the
river, flooding the heights above her with a silvery
light. The trees below were sharper in form, but
everything was very still; only the thunder of the fall
seemed to have increased in depth of tone. Millicent
shivered from the cold as she sent a sharp cry ringing
across the woods.
</p>
<p>This time it was answered, and she recognized the
voice. Looking down, she could see Lisle&#8217;s black figure
moving cautiously along the ledge, for although
the lower rocks were wrapped in shadow it is never altogether
dark in the northern summer. Coming out
into the moonlight, he examined the slab of rock which
had arrested her descent, but when he spoke she was
not quite pleased with his very matter-of-fact tone.
It left something to be desired&mdash;she thought he
might have displayed more satisfaction at finding her
safe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything you could catch hold of at the
top?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;If so, you&#8217;d better lower yourself
until I can reach you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Anxious as she was to get down, Millicent hesitated;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
if she did as he suggested she would descend into his
arms. She was not unduly prudish, and indeed, after
being left alone in the impressive solitude of the wilds,
she would have been glad of the reassuring grasp of
a human being. But an obscure feeling, springing,
perhaps, from primitive instincts, made her shrink
from close contact with this particular man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered coldly; &#8220;the rock is loose. Besides,
the ledge is narrow, and if I came down heavily,
we might both fall over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He again examined the slab, and then stood still,
considering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he decided, &#8220;there&#8217;s a crack some way up
that should give me a hold, and a bit of a projection
you could rest a foot on yonder. Then if you gave
me one hand, I could lower you down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He came up, thrusting his fingers into a fissure near
the summit and finding a tiny support for his toes.
Lowering herself cautiously, she clutched the hand he
extended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he cautioned, &#8220;as gently as possible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Loosing her hold above, she hung for a moment or
two, half afraid to let go his hand, while his arm and
body grew tense with the strain and she could hear his
labored breath. Summoning her courage she relaxed
her grasp. In another second she was safe upon the
ledge, and, scrambling down, he stood beside her with
a set, flushed face, the veins protruding on his forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad that&#8217;s over; I was badly scared,&#8221; he acknowledged.
</p>
<p>She thrilled at the confession, though she thought
there had been no serious risk; his concern for her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
safety was strangely pleasant and the strenuous grasp
of his fingers had stirred her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I believe I was quite safe after
you got hold of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He glanced at the steep face of broken rock that
ran down into the shadow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;d gone over, we might not have brought up
for a while,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But what&#8217;s that resting on
yonder jutting stone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s my sketch-book,&#8221; Millicent answered
unguardedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s nearly filled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then wait here a little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get it!&#8221; Millicent cried sharply.
&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t try!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite easy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent could not resist the temptation to make a
rather dangerous experiment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you were afraid a minute or two
ago!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, looking at her steadily. &#8220;But
that was different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She felt her heart-beats quicken and her face grow
hot, but she laid a restraining hand on his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be reasonable,&#8221; he urged, moving a pace
away. &#8220;That book stands for a good deal of high-grade
work. If you lose it, you will have wasted all
the first part of your journey. Besides, I should feel
very mean if I left it lying there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He lowered himself over the edge, and moving from
cranny to cranny and stone to stone, went cautiously
down, while she watched him with her hands closed
tight. What the actual peril was she could not estimate;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
but it looked appallingly dangerous, particularly
when in one place he had to descend from a
slightly overhanging stone. He reached the book,
however, and came up, and when at length he stood
beside her his expression was quite normal and he was
only a little breathless. Again she felt a disconcerting
thrill which was accompanied by a confused sense of
pride. What he had done was in her service, and this
time he had shown no sign of fear or strain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m a little angry&mdash;you
shouldn&#8217;t have gone. I should never have forgiven
myself if you had got hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was light enough to show that the blood crept
into his face; but he turned and glanced at the descending
ledge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better put your hand on my shoulder
where it&#8217;s steep,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Still, we&#8217;re not going
to have much trouble in getting down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had reached level ground before anything
more was said, and then she turned to him with a
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come before? You left me an
unpleasantly long while among the rocks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t miss you until supper,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;Then I set off at once, but I didn&#8217;t know which way
to look and the bush was pretty thick.&#8221; Stopping in
the moonlight, he indicated his rent attire. &#8220;I think
this speaks for itself,&#8221; he added humorously.
&#8220;There&#8217;s one consolation&mdash;the things belong to
Carew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent was glad that he was not going to be
serious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember that you didn&#8217;t bring much of an outfit,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
she replied. &#8220;I suppose you had one. What
became of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I left it behind, in pieces, on the thorns and rocks
along a good many leagues of trail; but it wasn&#8217;t extensive&mdash;when
you travel in this country you have
often to choose between food and clothes. It was obviously
impossible to buy any more, but the day before
we reached camp I made Crestwick cut my hair. After
a look at myself in Nasmyth&#8217;s pocket-glass, I&#8217;m inclined
to think he was unwarrantably proud of his success.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that they chatted lightly, until they walked
into the glow of the camp-fire, and while Bella and
Miss Hume plied Millicent with questions and congratulations,
Lisle took up Nasmyth&#8217;s repeating rifle
and fired it several times.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will bring the boys in,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll get Miss Gladwyne&#8217;s supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During the meal the others came back and when they
had all assembled, looking the worse for their scramble
through the bush, Crestwick, who had occasional lapses
from good behavior, addressed them collectively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t I right?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I offered anybody
three to one that Lisle would be the first to find her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you ought to be ashamed of it, after the
expensive way in which your confidence in your opinions
has often been shown to be mistaken,&#8221; declared
Bella. &#8220;Besides, you promised me you wouldn&#8217;t
waste your money that way again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This time I was backing a moral certainty,&#8221;
Crestwick rejoined. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t gambling; if you&#8217;re
not convinced, you can ask the others on what grounds
they were so unwilling to take me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>Receiving no encouragement, he addressed Millicent,
who was extremely vexed with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you know that you have given us all
a good deal of anxiety. You ought to feel contrite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sorry if I&#8217;ve given you a good deal of
trouble,&#8221; Millicent retorted. &#8220;You were a long time
in coming to my rescue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;is just the kind of thing
Bella used to delight in saying, though I&#8217;ll own that
she&#8217;s been much more civil lately. It&#8217;s possible that
Carew&#8217;s patience is not so long as mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you getting rather personal?&#8221; Carew
hinted.
</p>
<p>Crestwick subsided with an indulgent grimace, but
when they retired to their shelter Lisle turned upon
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It struck me that those jokes of yours were in
what you would call uncommonly bad form,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It would be better if you didn&#8217;t make any more of
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bella doesn&#8217;t mind; she&#8217;s used to me,&#8221; Crestwick
grinned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t referring to Bella&mdash;she has somebody to
take care of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Miss Gladwyne hasn&#8217;t? Still, that&#8217;s her own
fault, isn&#8217;t it? In my opinion, she has only to say
the word.&#8221; He paused, seeing his companion&#8217;s face
in the moonlight, for its expression was not encouraging.
&#8220;Oh, well!&#8221; he added, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t lose your
temper. There are people who can never see when a
thing&#8217;s humorous; I&#8217;ll wind up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Millicent sat in the entrance of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
tent, looking out between the dark trunks of the cedars
on the glittering river. It sluiced by, lapping noisily
upon the shingle, lined with streaks of froth, and the
roar of the neighboring fall filled the lonely gorge.
The wildness of her surroundings had its charm;
she had been happier among them than she had been
at any time during the last twelve months in England,
and now she was uneasily conscious of the reason.
Lisle&#8217;s constant watchfulness over her comfort, his
cheery conversation, even the sight of him when he
was too busy to talk, were strangely pleasant. She
realized why she had made him take the harder way
in helping her down from the rock and the knowledge
was disconcerting. She had been afraid to trust herself
to the clasp of his arms, but not because of any
want of confidence in him.
</p>
<p>Then she saw Carew kiss Bella among the cedars
before she left him to walk toward the tent, and the
sight stirred her blood. It was clear that she must be
on her guard; her guide must be kept firmly at a distance,
though this promised to be difficult. She was,
to all intents and purposes, pledged to Clarence; and
until Bella joined her she tried to fix her thoughts on
him, wondering where he was and what he was doing,
without being able to find much interest in the question.
</p>
<p>As it happened, Clarence was then sitting in a luxurious
parlor-car as a big west-bound train sped
through the forests of Ontario, but his face was
troubled and he felt ill at ease. A little more than
a fortnight earlier he had met Marple at a Swiss hotel,
and the man had informed him that Miss Gladwyne
and Miss Hume had sailed for Canada. Nasmyth, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
added, had gone by a previous steamer, to make arrangements
for some journey they wished to undertake.
This was the first intimation Clarence had
received. Millicent had written to him on the day before
she sailed, but the letter, following him to one
of the Italian valleys, had not yet reached him, and
he was filled with consternation. She had stolen away,
as if she did not wish to be burdened with his company;
she was going to visit the scene of her brother&#8217;s
death, no doubt under the guidance of Lisle, who had
strong suspicions concerning it. He might communicate
them to Millicent; perhaps he had done so already,
which would account for her silent departure. With
an effort Gladwyne roused himself to action. He made
up his mind to follow her and, if necessary, attempt
some defense. Perhaps, he thought, he could manage
to destroy any evidence of his treachery which the
Canadian had discovered.
</p>
<p>Still, he was tormented by doubts as he lounged in
the parlor-car, and, growing restless, he went out on
the rear platform and lighted a cigar. There was
faint moonlight, and dim trees fled past him; the rattle
of wheels and the rush of the cool wind was soothing.
He could not think while he stood holding on
by the brass rail to protect himself against the lurching,
and he found a relief in the roar as the great train
swept across a foaming river. They had been detained
at a junction during the afternoon, and the
engineer was evidently bent on making up the wasted
time.
</p>
<p>Presently the door of the next car opened, and
Gladwyne started violently as a dark figure came out
on to the platform.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Batley!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What in the name of wonder
has brought you here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Batley moving forward into the moonlight, regarded
him with a mocking smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing very remarkable; I&#8217;d several motives.
For one thing, I felt I&#8217;d like the trip&mdash;had a stroke
of luck not long ago which justified the expense.
British Columbia&#8217;s nowadays almost as accessible as
parts of Norway, where I&#8217;ve generally gone to, and I
understand it&#8217;s wilder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how is it I haven&#8217;t seen you on the train?&#8221;
Gladwyne asked, in no way reassured by the man&#8217;s
careless explanation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only got on at the last junction.&#8221; Batley&#8217;s tone
was significant as he proceeded. &#8220;I was too late for
your Allan boat; when I inquired about you in London
I found that you had gone; but I caught the next
New York Cunarder and came on by Buffalo. I suppose
you stopped a day or two in Montreal, which explains
how I&#8217;ve overtaken you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were held up by ice off Newfoundland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; suggested Batley, &#8220;suppose we go into
the smoking end of the car. I dare say you&#8217;d like a
talk and it&#8217;s rather noisy here. Besides, the cinders
are a little too plentiful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went in and Batley, lounging in a seat, lighted
a cigar and waited with an amused expression for the
other to begin. Gladwyne was intensely uneasy. It
had been a vast relief to be free from his companion,
and the last thing he desired was that Batley, who was
a remarkably keen-witted man, should go over the track
of George&#8217;s expedition in company with Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d be glad if you would tell me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
exactly why you followed me. The reason you gave
didn&#8217;t seem sufficient.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then my other object ought to be clear. You&#8217;re
carrying a good deal of my money; I felt it would be
wiser to keep an eye on you. As I said, I&#8217;d had a
stroke of luck that enabled me to get away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that means somebody has suffered!&#8221;
Gladwyne, in his bitterness, could not help the injudicious
sneer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; returned Batley good-humoredly. &#8220;In
this case, I&#8217;d set a man on his feet&mdash;it&#8217;s now and
then as profitable as pulling one down, and my methods
aren&#8217;t always destructive. The fellow was straight
and I&#8217;m inclined to believe he was grateful. I don&#8217;t
think he could have found anybody else to back him,
but I&#8217;m not afraid of a risk.&#8221; He paused and smiled
at his companion. &#8220;Sometimes I make mistakes; I
did so with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne flushed, but Batley proceeded:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may remind you that when I financed you I
was led to believe that you would succeed to a handsome
property; not one that was stripped of its working
capital. I&#8217;ll give you credit for misleading me
rather cleverly. All this is to the point, because it
explains my watchful attitude. You&#8217;re the kind of
man I prefer to keep in sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Disgust, humiliation and anger possessed Gladwyne,
but he knew that he was in his companion&#8217;s hands,
and he did not think that Batley had stated all of his
reasons yet. It was possible that he expected to discover
something in British Columbia that would
strengthen his hold on his victim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied with an attempt at calmness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
&#8220;we needn&#8217;t quarrel, since it looks as if we&#8217;d have to
put up with each other for some time. Have you
finished what you have to say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite. There&#8217;s one question yet. When do
you expect to marry Miss Gladwyne?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that to you?&#8221; Clarence broke out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just this&mdash;I&#8217;m anxious to form some idea as to
when I&#8217;m likely to get my money back. Since Miss
Crestwick dropped you, there&#8217;s only Miss Gladwyne
available, so far as I know, and you have got to
marry money and do so pretty soon. I&#8217;m willing to
do anything that may help on the match.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladwyne&#8217;s face burned, he looked savage, but
Batley continued to watch him with an ironical smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to drive you too hard, but I&#8217;m only
stating an obvious fact,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll
leave you to think it over while I interview the porter
of the sleeping-car.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>CLARENCE REACHES CAMP</h3>
</div>

<p>The evening was dull and gloomy, a gray sky
hung over the desolate hills, and Millicent, sitting
alone on a rocky slope, felt troubled and
depressed. Beneath her, the long hollow that crossed
the big divide stretched back, colored in cheerless
neutral tints, into drifting mist. It was sprinkled
with little ponds, and banded here and there with belts
of stunted trees, small birches and willows, and ragged
cedars that hid the oozy muskegs under them.
</p>
<p>The girl was worn with travel, for Lisle had
abandoned the canoes some time ago, and the party
had followed, by what he called easy stages, the trail
he and the packers had broken, though the women
had found the way hard enough. This, he had informed
them, would shorten the journey a good deal,
and he expected to fall in with some Indians, from
whom canoes could be obtained, once they had crossed
the divide; failing this, they might be compelled to
retrace their steps.
</p>
<p>It was up the forbidding hollow they had lately
reached that George Gladwyne had doggedly plodded,
faint with hunger, on his last journey. Millicent had
followed his trail for the past two days and she had
found them filled with painful memories. All that
Lisle had shown her had brought back her brother and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
once more she mourned for him. But that was an old
wound that had partly healed and she could face the
sorrowful story of George&#8217;s last struggles with a certain
pride; he had endured with unwavering courage,
and the manner of his death became him. The girl
had other troubles which clouded the present and filled
her with misgivings for the future.
</p>
<p>During her first few weeks in the wilderness, lying
all day under clear sunshine and cloudless skies, it
had seemed to her an enchanted land. Snow-peaks,
and crystal lakes that mirrored ranks of climbing firs,
struck her as endowed with an almost unearthly
beauty and as wonderful a tranquillity; and when she
pushed on through the savage portals of the mountains
there was something that stirred her nature in
the sight of the foaming rivers and the roar of the
spray-veiled falls. Now, however, the glamour had
gone, it had been rudely banished on the night when
Lisle had helped her down the rocks. She, who had
allowed Clarence to believe that she would marry him,
had found a strange delight in the company of another
man; one whom she might have loved had she
been free, she tried to convince herself, in a determined
attempt to hide the fact that her heart cried out for
him.
</p>
<p>Lisle had pushed on with a single companion on the
previous night to see if he could obtain canoes; the
packers were breaking a trail, and the others were
resting in camp. Millicent was glad of this, for she
wanted to be alone. Suddenly, as she looked down the
hollow, two indistinct figures appeared out of the mist.
The packers had gone up the valley, but there was
no doubt that it was two men she saw, and they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
apparently making for the camp. As the party had
met nobody since entering the wilderness, she felt curious
about the strangers. There was something in the
carriage of one of them that seemed familiar; and
then the uneasiness of which she had already been
conscious became intensified as she recognized that he
walked like Clarence.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later the men were hidden by a
growth of willows and she sped back to camp, scrambling
among the rocks with a haste that was born of
nervous tension. She did not see the men again&mdash;it
was needful to pick a path down the steep descent
very carefully&mdash;and when she came, breathless, upon
the clump of birches among which the tents were pitched
it was evident from the hum of voices that the
strangers had already arrived. Pushing in among the
trees, she stopped, with her heart beating unpleasantly
fast, face to face with Clarence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he exclaimed, moving forward to meet her;
&#8220;now I&#8217;m rewarded for my journey. How fit and
brown you look, Millicent!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stood still a moment, with an expressionless
face, finding no words to say; then with an effort
she roused herself and shook hands with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have had a trying march if you followed
our trail,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But how did you get
here&mdash;I mean why did you leave Switzerland?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick chuckled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very much what we all asked him,&#8221; he
broke in. &#8220;In one way, it&#8217;s hardly civil; if we&#8217;d
known he was coming, we&#8217;d have been better prepared
to express our delight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad was not, as a rule, considerate and he suffered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
from want of tact, but there was truth behind
what he said. It is given to only a few to be sure
of a warm and sincere welcome when they take their
friends by surprise. Nasmyth frowned at Crestwick,
who had rashly hinted at the feeling of constraint that
had seized upon the party. Millicent, however, was
looking at Gladwyne and her heart grew softer as she
noticed his weariness and his strained expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said when he had answered her, &#8220;you
must sit down and rest. Nasmyth and Crestwick will
get you something to eat as soon as possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not what she would have wished to say&mdash;it
sounded dreadfully commonplace&mdash;but Batley came
forward with an easy laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid our young friend&#8221;&mdash;he indicated
Crestwick&mdash;&#8220;is not a diplomatist, but on the whole
his fault&#8217;s a good one; he&#8217;s more or less honest. You&#8217;ll
forgive us for surprising you; it was quite impossible
to send you a warning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent smiled, the tension suddenly slackened, and
as the packer who cooked was away with his comrade,
they all set about preparing a meal which, thanks to
Batley, was eaten amid a flow of lively conversation.
The man was weary, but he could rise to an occasion
and summon to his aid a genial wit. Clarence was glad
of this; fatigue had reacted on him, increasing his
anxiety, and he had been chilled by the coldness of his
reception. Even the cordiality his companions now
displayed was suspicious, because it suggested that
they wished to atone for something that had previously
been lacking. He ate, however, and talked when he
found an opportunity, and afterward acquiesced when
Millicent declined to be drawn away from the others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>When the meal was finished, they sat close together
about the fire, for coldness came with the dusk, but by
degrees the conversation languished. The increasing
chill, the gloom and the desolation of their surroundings
affected them all; and nobody had been quite at
ease since Gladwyne&#8217;s arrival. He was too tired to
make more than spasmodic attempts to talk, and
though Millicent was sorry for him she could not help
contrasting him with Lisle. She had seen the latter
almost worn out with severe labor, but even then he
had been cheerful, ready to encourage his companions
with lively badinage. He seemed to take pleasure in
forcing his body to the utmost strain it could bear.
</p>
<p>The light had died away into the partial obscurity
which would last until sunrise when Lisle walked into
camp. The fire had burned up, and Millicent saw his
start and his face set hard at the sight of Gladwyne.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a surprise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When did you get
here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About two hours ago. We found where you left
the water and followed up your trail,&#8221; Gladwyne answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How many packers and what stores did you
bring?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two packers,&#8221; replied Gladwyne. &#8220;There were
no more available at the last settlement. Batley has a
list of the provisions&mdash;we cut them down as much as
possible. As we were anxious to overtake you, we
traveled light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle took the list Batley gave him and examined it
by the glow of the fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if you didn&#8217;t mind endangering the
safety of the whole party,&#8221; he broke out. &#8220;This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
expedition is already quite large enough, and you add
four people to it with less than half the necessary
stores, so that you could save yourself a little trouble
on the journey! What&#8217;s more important, we can&#8217;t
make up for the shortage by better speed. Only two
of you can pack an average load, though all four must
be fed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent had listened, hot with anger and a little
surprised. Lisle had his faults, including a shortness
of temper, but he was now showing a strain of
what she considered primitive barbarism which he had
hitherto concealed. A cultured Englishman would
have led Clarence aside or waited for an opportunity
before remonstrating with him; and then her face
burned as she wondered whether Lisle had been actuated
by savage jealousy. It was, however, insufferable
that he should display it in this fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must point out that I organized the expedition,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Everybody here is my guest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you invite Gladwyne and Batley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not,&#8221; Millicent was compelled to own. &#8220;For
all that, they are now in the same position as the rest.
I must ask you to remember it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle had some trouble in controlling himself, but he
nodded. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he responded, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to alter
several of our arrangements and I&#8217;ll go along and talk
it over with the packers. I&#8217;ve got the canoes required,
and we&#8217;ll take the trail at seven to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He strode away toward the packers&#8217; fire, quite aware
that he had not behaved in a very seemly way, but
still consumed with indignation against Gladwyne.
When he had disappeared, Clarence looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry if we have given you unnecessary trouble;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
but does your guide often adopt that rather
hectoring tone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His languid contempt roused Crestwick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lisle&#8217;s responsible for the safety of all of us,&#8221;
the lad broke out, &#8220;and you haven&#8217;t shown much regard
for it in making your loads as light as you
could!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent raised her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about something else for a few minutes
and then break up. It&#8217;s an early start to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They dispersed shortly afterward, but Batley sought
Lisle before retiring to rest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I regret that we have added to your anxiety,&#8221; he
began. &#8220;Of course, transport is a serious difficulty&mdash;I&#8217;ve
had some little experience of this kind of
thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the field?&#8221; Lisle asked bluntly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a
suspicion of it. Then why didn&#8217;t you remember?&#8221;
He saw Batley&#8217;s smile, for they were standing by the
packers&#8217; fire. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t trouble
to shield Gladwyne. I formed my opinion of him
some time ago&mdash;he&#8217;s a mighty poor specimen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m inclined to agree with you,&#8221; replied Batley
dryly.
</p>
<p>They set off early the next morning, and after his
forced march, Gladwyne found the load given him
sufficiently heavy. He was badly jaded, aching all
over, and disturbed in mind, when they camped near
the summit of the divide late in the afternoon without
his having been able to secure a word with Millicent
alone. He felt that he must gain her consent to a
formal engagement before Lisle let fall any hint of
his suspicions, which he did not believe had been done
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
so far. Afterward, knowing Millicent, he thought
she would staunchly refuse to listen to anything to
his discredit, and he could, if it were needful, ascribe
Lisle&#8217;s attack to jealousy. He must, however, also
contrive to push on ahead of the party, on some
excuse, and obliterate any remaining trace of the
former expedition&#8217;s provision caches; then he would
be safe.
</p>
<p>Millicent had strolled away from the others and was
standing among the rocks when he overtook her. The
signs of fatigue and tension in his face softened her
toward him. Still, it was only compassion; she felt
no thrill, but rather an involuntary shrinking and a
sense of alarm. She was to be called upon to fulfil a
duty to which she had somehow pledged herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Millicent,&#8221; he began, &#8220;things can&#8217;t go on as they
have been doing&mdash;pleasant as it was. I have waited
patiently, but you can&#8217;t expect too much. Now I
have come a long way to claim my reward. I want
the right to look after you, and to tell the others so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His abruptness and hoarseness were expressive, but
she felt that there was something lacking and she answered
with a flippancy she seldom indulged in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You thought it needful to bring your privy
counselor with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he came without even asking my permission.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, sitting down with forced calmness,
&#8220;it doesn&#8217;t matter; but are you quite sure now that
you really want me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no doubt that he was desperately anxious
for her formal word; there was a feverish eagerness
in his eyes. It puzzled her, but it left her unmoved
and cold.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Want you!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Can you ask? Haven&#8217;t
I constantly shown my devotion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last few months&mdash;I mean after Lisle
went back to Canada,&#8221; she replied with gathering
color. &#8220;Before then, for a time, I think one could
reasonably have doubted it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked confused; that Bella had attracted him
had been obvious, and there was no way of getting
over the fact gracefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I have my weaknesses&mdash;want of balance,
impulsiveness, and a capacity for being easily
piqued,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;Well, though perhaps I deserved
it, you were cold and aloof enough to madden a
more patient man, and I suppose I slackly yielded to
wounded vanity. All the time, you were the one I
had chosen, the only woman who had ever really
stirred or could influence me. Nearly as long as I
can remember I have loved and respected you. Occasionally
you unbent enough to show me that you
recognized it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was some truth in this, and seeing the change
in her expression, he went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t cast me off and fling me back upon
myself&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t face that. During those last few
months in England, you helped me forward far more
than you suspected&mdash;showed me my duties, enabled
me to carry them out. I can&#8217;t go on alone; I&#8217;m your
responsibility; having taken it up, you can&#8217;t deny it
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent smiled faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she admitted; &#8220;I suppose that would be
hardly fair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He would have thrown his arm about her, but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
laid a hand on his shoulder and with gentle firmness
held him back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, with a deep color in her face; &#8220;not
yet. We have been associated as cousins; I must get
used to the new position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had wit enough to yield, but he kissed her hands
exultantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pledge! I may tell the others?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she consented quietly, &#8220;I think you may.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a while he sat at her feet, with her hand on
his shoulder, talking about the future, and she was
sensible of a certain calm satisfaction which had in it
more than a trace of resignation. She had not shirked
her duty, she was safe from temptation, and she had
after all a sincere, half-pitying tenderness for the
man. Her liking for him would, she thought, grow
stronger, and the passion which Lisle had once or twice
half awakened in her was a thing to be subdued and
dreaded. Though Gladwyne saw that she was but
lightly moved, he was content, and some time had
passed when they went slowly back together to the
camp.
</p>
<p>Miss Hume was the first to notice them and when
Millicent smiled she went hastily forward and kissed
her. Then Bella joined them and Batley offered his
good wishes in fitting terms. When Lisle and Nasmyth
came up, a word from Bella was sufficient
for them. For a moment the girl was startled by
what she read in the Canadian&#8217;s face. It was, however,
invisible to Millicent. Turning suddenly round without
speaking he strode away, followed by Nasmyth.
Stopping when he was hidden from the camp among
the rocks Lisle turned savagely to his companion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You heard what Bella said!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did!&#8221; replied Nasmyth. &#8220;The hound! It
must be stopped!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; asserted Lisle, more coolly, &#8220;that&#8217;s a sure
thing. Still, there are difficulties&mdash;she may not believe
my story now. I almost think I&#8217;ll wait until we
reach the two caches; then with something to back my
statements, I might force the truth from him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, you had better watch him,&#8221; warned
Nasmyth, looking deeply disturbed. &#8220;He may try
to reach them first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next moment Crestwick joined them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to be done, Vernon?&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Miss Gladwyne&#8217;s engagement&#8217;s formally announced&mdash;it
can&#8217;t go on!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Lisle&#8217;s voice was stern. &#8220;What has it to
do with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; explained Crestwick, hesitating, &#8220;the man&#8217;s
not to be trusted, he&#8217;s dangerous. He simply can&#8217;t
be allowed to make this match!&#8221; He paused and
spread out his hands. &#8220;I&#8217;m horribly troubled about
it&mdash;I&#8217;d better tell you that I know&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know nothing that need be mentioned,&#8221; Lisle
interrupted him. &#8220;That&#8217;s positive; you have to remember
it. As to the rest, you&#8217;ll leave the matter
entirely in my hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; agreed Crestwick, &#8220;if you order it.
That relieves me of my responsibility. I&#8217;m uncommonly
glad to get rid of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle abruptly strode away, and Crestwick saw that
Nasmyth was regarding him curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lisle was quite right,&#8221; Nasmyth said. &#8220;He only
forestalled me in instructions I meant to give you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you understand what I was referring to?&#8221;
exclaimed Crestwick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a good idea,&#8221; Nasmyth answered dryly. &#8220;In
my opinion, so has Lisle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you were on the far side of the hedge on the
morning we tried the horse, and Lisle was down. He
wasn&#8217;t conscious when I broke through the thorns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite correct; but it&#8217;s most unlikely he lost consciousness
from the fall, and he was lying with his
face turned toward the jump&mdash;it wasn&#8217;t until the
chestnut came down on his shoulder that he was badly
hurt. The doctor agreed with me on that point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That might have struck me,&#8221; Crestwick rejoined.
&#8220;But you owned that you had an idea of what happened
at the jump. How did you get it? Did Lisle
tell you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m firmly convinced that he&#8217;ll never mention what
he saw or suspects to anybody, unless it&#8217;s to Gladwyne.
As to the rest, the hedge wasn&#8217;t thick enough
to prevent my seeing through it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an unusual man,&#8221; declared Crestwick in an
admiring tone. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t met his equal. But I&#8217;ll
keep my eye on Gladwyne&mdash;there&#8217;s risk enough at
some of the rapids&mdash;the hound shan&#8217;t have another
chance if I can help it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They turned and went back to camp, but on reaching
it they sat down among the packers, avoiding
Gladwyne and Millicent.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>A BOLD SCHEME</h3>
</div>

<p>The sense of security which Millicent experienced
on announcing her engagement was not permanent
and in a few days the doubts that had
troubled her crept back into her mind. She had never
entertained any marked illusions about Clarence and
although, now that she was irrevocably pledged to
him, she endeavored to fix her thoughts on his most
likable qualities, even these appeared in a less favorable
light than they had formerly done. The growth
of the warmer attachment she had expected to feel
was strangely slow, and though it was early to indulge
in regrets her heart sometimes grew heavy as
she looked forward to the future. Clarence was considerate,
attentive and deferential in a polished way,
but he lacked something one looked for in a lover.
Besides, she was anxious about him; he looked worn,
his manner suggested that he was bearing a strain,
but this was in his favor, for it roused her compassion.
She fancied that the cause of it was financial,
and this in a sense was encouraging, because this was
a trouble from which she could purchase him immunity.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile she was stirred by mournful
memories as she followed the last stages of her
brother&#8217;s journey and visited the lonely spot where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
he had met his end. Somehow the thought of him
encouraged her&mdash;George had quietly done his duty,
regardless of the cost, and even if her burden proved
heavy, which it was premature to admit, she must bear
it cheerfully.
</p>
<p>At length they stopped one evening at a portage,
and Lisle examined the stores.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The food&#8217;s getting short,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;One
or two of you had better take out your rifles the first
thing to-morrow, while the rest go fishing. I&#8217;ll tackle
the portage with two packers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He began his work at sunrise the next morning and
it was toward evening when Crestwick came back exultant
with a blacktail buck. Nasmyth was fishing
near the camp and Lisle was busy with a canoe near by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the rest? How have they got on?&#8221;
Lisle asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Batley went back to the last reach with
Carew&#8217;s rod,&#8221; Crestwick answered. &#8220;I met Gladwyne
and one of the packers on the low range back yonder;
they&#8217;d only got a blue grouse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could have done with the man here,&#8221; said Lisle.
&#8220;Which way were they heading?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Back up-river, the way we came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle made no comment, but Crestwick thought he
found the information reassuring, and thrusting out
the canoe he was swept away down the easiest part
of the rapid, while Crestwick assisted Nasmyth to
land a trout. Lisle had returned to the camp when
the packer who had accompanied Clarence came in
alone, bringing a couple of grouse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become of Mr. Gladwyne?&#8221; Lisle asked
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t he got back?&#8221; replied the other, glancing
about. &#8220;I lost him on the far slope of the bluff
about noon, but as he could see the river most anywhere
from the top I went right on. There was a
deer trail I was trying to follow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle said nothing more to the packer but walked
rapidly toward where the cook was getting supper
ready. Nasmyth followed him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you give Mr. Gladwyne any lunch to carry
with him when he left camp?&#8221; Lisle asked the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was busy when he came along and I told him to
look around for himself. I think he took some canned
stuff and there was quite a big loaf missing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring the box you keep the canned goods in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The cook produced it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two meat cans gone, anyway,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Looks as if Mr. Gladwyne figured on getting
mighty hungry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put me up enough bread and fish for two of us
for two days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved away with Nasmyth, and they had left the
fire behind when he spoke, his voice hoarse with anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladwyne&#8217;s gone to the cache! He&#8217;s got half a
day&#8217;s clear start of us and he knows the country.
It&#8217;s pretty open and he&#8217;ll make quite a good pace
on a straight trail, while the river bends. Get the
stuff I asked for while I give the others a few instructions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to start after him at once?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as you&#8217;re ready,&#8221; Lisle said shortly.
</p>
<p>He turned back toward where the others were sitting
waiting for supper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As Gladwyne hasn&#8217;t turned up, Nasmyth and I
are going to look for him,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing to be alarmed about, but it&#8217;s quite likely we
may not be back in the morning. If we don&#8217;t turn
up by noon, you had better start down-river and we&#8217;ll
pick you up farther on. I don&#8217;t want to waste another
day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he has got lost altogether?&#8221; Millicent
asked anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Lisle, in a reassuring manner.
&#8220;Still, some of these ridges are bad to climb and quite
a lot of things may happen to delay him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He called to a packer and gave him definite orders to
take the party down-river and wait at a spot agreed
upon; and a few minutes later he and Nasmyth left
the camp.
</p>
<p>Shortly afterward Batley came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the others?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>They told him and he looked thoughtful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So Lisle started at once! Which way did he and
Nasmyth go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Up the ridge behind us, but they turned down-stream
when they reached the top,&#8221; Carew replied.
</p>
<p>Batley scented a mystery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go after them; I
might be useful. Of course, you&#8217;ll start to-morrow
as Lisle told you, and if I&#8217;m not back by then, I&#8217;ll
follow the river to the rendezvous he mentioned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He disappeared, as did Crestwick, who came in for
supper later on, and as the packers had pitched their
tent lower down, there was now only Carew left with
the women in camp. They were all a little uneasy as
dusk grew near; the haste with which the men had set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
out one after another struck them as ominous. Bella&#8217;s
mind was unusually active, for she had promptly decided
that there was something behind all this, and
when at last Millicent strolled away from the others
she followed her to the edge of the water. A ridge
of rock cut them off from view of the camp and
though she fancied that Millicent was not pleased to
see her, Bella sat down upon a stone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, the anxiety that Lisle and the rest have
shown to find Clarence is flattering,&#8221; she began, expressing
part of her thoughts. &#8220;I wonder if they&#8217;d
all have gone off in such a hurry if Jim had got lost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your brother knows the bush,&#8221; returned Millicent,
hiding her fears.
</p>
<p>Bella did not respond to this. She had decided that
Millicent must not be allowed to marry Gladwyne, but
she could not bring herself to denounce the man. If
that must be done, somebody else would have to undertake
the task. At the same time, she felt it incumbent
on her to give the girl some warning, or at least to find
out how far her confidence in her lover went, in order
to determine how advice could best be offered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you feel quite sure you will be happy
with Clarence?&#8221; she ventured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have provoked the retort&mdash;were you convinced
that you would be happy with Arthur Carew,
when you made up your mind to marry him so suddenly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella&#8217;s smile expressed forbearance. It was getting
dark, but she could see the hot flush in her companion&#8217;s
cheeks and the sparkle in her eyes. Neither
was encouraging, but Bella was not easily, daunted,
and she felt that her persistence was really meritorious,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
considering that until lately Millicent had never been
cordial to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;d better answer,&#8221; she said sweetly. &#8220;I
was sure of Arthur, and that means a good deal more
than that I knew he was in love with me&mdash;I don&#8217;t
suppose you heard that he&#8217;d proposed to me once
before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you take him then?&#8221; Millicent asked
coldly. &#8220;Remember you have justified my being
personal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bella grew rather hot&mdash;when Carew had made his
first offer she had been in eager pursuit of Gladwyne&mdash;but
she sternly suppressed a desire to retaliate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we need go into that,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;As I said, I was sure of Arthur&mdash;I knew his character,
knew he was better than I am, that he could be
depended on. He&#8217;s the kind of man one is safe with;
I felt that the more I saw of him, the more I could
trust him. Perhaps the feeling&#8217;s a safer guide than
passion&mdash;it stands longer wear&mdash;and now I&#8217;m getting
to like him better every day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her voice dropped to a tender note and Millicent
felt a little astonished, and ashamed of her harshness.
This was a new Bella, one in whose existence she could
hardly have believed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t quite finished, though I don&#8217;t often talk
like this,&#8221; Bella went on. &#8220;I feel that without the
confidence I&#8217;ve tried to describe marriage must be a
terrible risk&mdash;one might find such ugly qualities in
the man; even defects you could forgive beforehand
would become so much worse when you had to suffer
because of them. Of course, one can&#8217;t expect perfection,
but there ought to be something&mdash;honor, a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
heart, a generous mind&mdash;that one can rely on as a
sure foundation. When you have that, you can build,
and even then the building may be difficult.&#8221; She
paused before she concluded: &#8220;My dear, I&#8217;m happier
than I deserve to be; I have chosen wisely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nothing more was said for a few minutes, but Bella,
studying her companion&#8217;s face, was more or less content.
Millicent&#8217;s faith in Clarence was weak, she was
forcing herself to believe in him; it might be possible
to make her see her lover in his true character, though
Bella had not yet determined on the exact course she
would adopt. Then Carew called from the camp and
she went back, while Millicent sat still with grave
doubts in her heart. Bella&#8217;s faith in her husband was
warranted, and Millicent was enough of an optimist
to believe that such men were not uncommon&mdash;there
was Lisle, for example, and Nasmyth. With them one
would undoubtedly have something to build a happy
and profitable life upon&mdash;but what could be done
with one in whom there was no foundation, only the
shifting sands of impulses, or, perhaps, unsounded
depths of weakness into which the painfully-raised
edifice might crumble? She stove to convince herself
that she was becoming wickedly hypercritical, thinking
treasonably of her lover, particularly in contrasting
him with her guide. There must be no more of that,
and she rose and walked back to her tent with a resolution
that cost her an effort.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Lisle and Nasmyth were pushing
on as fast as possible along the stony summit of the
ridge. There was moonlight, which made it a little
easier, but they stumbled every now and then. Here
and there they were forced to scramble down the sides
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
of a gully and on reaching the bottom to plunge into
water, and once they had to scramble some distance
shut in by the rocks before they could find a means of
ascending. Still, they were hard and inured to fatigue,
and they never slackened the pace. When
striding along a stretch of smoother ground Nasmyth
gathered breath to speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were easily taken in,&#8221; he declared; &#8220;though
the thing was cunningly planned. Gladwyne took the
packer with him and headed back at first, to divert
suspicion. It would be easy enough to lose the man
and turn down-stream again; and that he intended
something of the kind is proved by his taking so
much food with him. No doubt, he&#8217;d rather have
avoided that, in case it looked suspicious, but he&#8217;s had
one hungry march over the same ground, and I dare
say it was quite enough. Besides, he could defy us
once he&#8217;d emptied and obliterated the caches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You understand the way your people&#8217;s minds work
better than I do,&#8221; Lisle returned dryly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s natural, isn&#8217;t it? The idea that I&#8217;m most
impressed with just now is that Millicent might believe
it her duty to stick to Clarence more closely because
of a tale that was merely damaging. She would
never allow herself or anybody else to credit it, unless
she had absolutely convincing proof.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Lisle; &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s
precisely why we have got to get there first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A thicket of thorny vines and canes barred his way,
but he went straight at the midst of it and struggled
through, savagely smashing and rending down the
brush. The clothes he had borrowed from Carew
looked considerably the worse for wear when he came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
out; and then he recklessly leaped across a dark cleft
the bottom of which he could not see. Presently they
left the ridge and headed away from the river, which
flowed round a wide curve, and toward dawn they were
brought up by a ravine. The roar of water rose
hoarsely from its depths. The moon was getting low
and the silvery light did not reach far down the opposite
side, but they could see a sheer, smooth wall of
rock, and the width of the chasm rendered any attempt
to jump it out of the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No way of getting across here,&#8221; decided Lisle.
&#8220;At the same time, it looks as if Gladwyne must be
held up on the same side that we are. We&#8217;ll follow
the cañon; down-stream, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The moonlight was getting dimmer, but, at some
risk of falling into the rift, they pushed on along
the brink, looking down as they went. They could
see no means of descending, but at length, when rocks
and trees were getting blacker and a little more distinct
in the chilly dawn, they made out a fallen trunk
with broken white branches lying upon a tall mass
of rock below.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve an idea that the top of that tree reached
across to this side when it first came down,&#8221; Lisle
said. &#8220;Have you got a match?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth had brought a few carefully-treasured
wax matches with him, and he lighted one. It was
very still, except for the roar of the hidden torrent,
and the pale flame burned steadily in the motionless
cold air. It showed a couple of hollows, where something
had rested, close to the edge of the rift, and
one or two fresh scratches on a strip of rock. Lisle
stooped down beside them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hold the thing lower!&#8221; he exclaimed sharply.
&#8220;It&#8217;s as I suspected&mdash;this is where Gladwyne got
across; though he has better nerves than I thought
he had. The broken end of a branch or two rested
right here, and he was smart enough to heave the butt
off the other bank, after he&#8217;d crawled over. Looks to
me as if it had broken off yonder stump. Guess
there&#8217;ll be light enough to look for a way across in
half an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sitting down he filled his pipe, and shortly afterward
he raised one hand as if listening. For a while,
Nasmyth could hear nothing except the roar of water;
there was not a sound that he could catch in the thin
straggling bush behind them where few trails of mist
were stretched athwart the trees. Then he started as
a faint crackling and snapping began in the distance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it be a bear?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s a man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth was somewhat astonished. They had not
seen a human being except those of their party for
a long while, and it seemed strange that they should
come across one now in the early dawn in those remote
wilds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s wearing boots,&#8221; he said diffidently, as the
crackling drew nearer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Lisle responded; &#8220;he&#8217;s making a good deal
more noise than a bushman would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sound steadily approached them. Nasmyth
found something mysterious and rather eerie in it, and
he was on the whole relieved when a dark figure materialized
among the trees near by. He could barely see
it, but Lisle called out sharply:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has brought you on our trail, Batley?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>The man came toward them with a breathless laugh
and sat down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t your trail but Gladwyne&#8217;s I&#8217;m interested
in, and I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve succeeded in following
that. I merely pushed on, until I struck this cañon
and as I couldn&#8217;t get across, I followed it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not easily scared,&#8221; Lisle commented.
&#8220;You might have got lost. Guess you had some
motive that made you take the risk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt pretty safe. You see, I knew I could strike
the river, if necessary. At the same time you were
right about the motive&mdash;in fact, there&#8217;s no use in
trying to hide it. I may as well confess that I&#8217;d
sooner keep Gladwyne in sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of regard for his welfare?&#8221; Nasmyth asked.
</p>
<p>Batley laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not altogether. The fact is, he&#8217;s carrying a good
deal of my money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One should have imagined that you&#8217;d have had
him well insured.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite correct. If he came to grief in
England, I shouldn&#8217;t anticipate any trouble, but it
would be different out here and, everything considered,
I&#8217;d rather avoid complications with the insurance companies.
Now that I&#8217;ve been candid, do you feel inclined
to reciprocate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; Lisle replied shortly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
sure I even sympathize. But since you&#8217;ve turned up
you&#8217;ll have to stick to us; I don&#8217;t want to waste time
in leading another search party. As soon as there&#8217;s
a little more light, we&#8217;ll try to get across the cañon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for the permission,&#8221; smiled Batley, lighting
a cigar.

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE END OF THE PURSUIT</h3>
</div>

<p>By degrees the light got clearer, the scattered
black cedars grew into definite form, and a
strip of foaming water showed in the depths
of the chasm. Lisle walked some distance along the
edge, searching for an easier place to cross, but the
rocks were smooth and almost perpendicular except
where they overhung the torrent. He went back to
where the others were sitting and found that they had
been joined by Crestwick, who briefly explained that
having set out on their trail he had been stopped by
the cañon and had followed it up until it led him to
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks worse farther along; we&#8217;ll have to try it
here,&#8221; Lisle announced. &#8220;Can you get down, Nasmyth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced into the rift. It was, he judged,
nearly sixty feet in depth, but part of the bank on
which he stood had slipped down into the stream, leaving
an uneven surface by means of which an agile man
might descend. A tall slab of rock, evidently part of
the fallen mass, rose in a pinnacle from the water,
and on top of it rested the branches of the tree that
Gladwyne had used as a bridge and had afterward
dislodged. The rock behind it on the opposite bank
was absolutely smooth, but the thicker end of the log,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
which had fallen against the face, reached to within
about nine feet of the summit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, answering Lisle&#8217;s question; &#8220;but
I&#8217;m very doubtful whether I can get up the other side.
The last bit looks particularly awkward; there&#8217;s an
outward bulge just beneath the top.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might manage it by giving the leader a lift,
if we got so far,&#8221; Batley suggested, pointing to the
sharp slab. &#8220;That pike should help us; I think it
would go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it would go?&#8221; queried Nasmyth meaningly.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you mixing idioms? Pike&#8217;s what
we&#8217;d say round Wasdale, and your other expression&#8217;s
not uncommon in Switzerland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Batley laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll own that I&#8217;ve done some rock work in both
districts, though I was thinner then. But I&#8217;ve an
idea that time&#8217;s precious to our leader.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He lowered himself over the edge and finding foothold,
went down cautiously by crack and fissure, while
the others followed with some trouble. Alighting
waist-deep in a frothing rush of water, he was driven
for a few yards down-stream, and it was only by seeking
the support of the rock that he slowly made head
against the torrent. Lisle joined him when he reached
the foot of the pinnacle, where they stopped to gather
breath with a thin shower of spray whirling about
them. The light was still dim down in the bottom of
the chasm, and the mass of rock ran up above them,
shadowy, black and almost smooth.
</p>
<p>Wasting no time in examination, Lisle flung himself
upon it, seeking for a grip with elbows and knees.
He had ascended a yard or two when he lost hold and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
coming down with a run fell with a splash into the
stream.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d manage it that way,&#8221; Batley
remarked. &#8220;The edge appears a little more promising.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went up, with Lisle following, finding hold for
knees and fingers, while Nasmyth and Crestwick, panting
heavily, encouraged each other below. On reaching
the top of the pinnacle, Batley lay upon it and
gave Lisle his hand; and when he had drawn him up
he pointed to the tree.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go first, for reasons that will become apparent
later,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Hold on to the log; it doesn&#8217;t
seem firmly fixed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tree was small and when Lisle shook it the butt
moved against the face of the rock, which was separated
by a broad gap from the top of the fallen mass.
Batley was heavy, but he ascended cautiously, while
Lisle leaned upon the log to steady it. Then, calling
Nasmyth to take his place, Lisle went up. When he
was near the top, it looked as if their progress must
abruptly cease. The butt was narrow and the summit
of the rock above it projected somewhat. There was
not the smallest knob or crevice one could grasp, and
below them in the shadowy rift the torrent boiled
furiously among massy stones. It was not a place
to slip in.
</p>
<p>Batley, however, rose very carefully, with his feet
upon the shattered butt and his hands pressed against
the rock, until he stood almost upright.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to climb up over me until you can get
your fingers on the top,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Take time when
you get up and feel for a good hold.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>Reaching his shoulders, Lisle stood on them while
Nasmyth and Crestwick on the pinnacle beneath looked
up at a somewhat impressive spectacle. Lisle&#8217;s head
and shoulders were now above the edge, but he was
forced to bend backward and outward by the projecting
bulge which pressed against his breast, and his
cautious movements suggested that he could find no
hold. It appeared impossible for him to descend, unless
he did so accidentally, and in that event nothing
could save him from a fall to the bottom of the ravine.
For a while, they watched his tense figure moving
futilely; and then Batley, standing most precariously
poised, bent his arm and seized one of Lisle&#8217;s feet.
He spoke in a breathless gasp as he thrust it upward;
Lisle&#8217;s legs swung free and he disappeared beyond
the edge. The two below were conscious of a vast
relief. It was tempered, however, by the knowledge
that they must shortly emulate their companion&#8217;s
exploit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take off your pack!&#8221; Batley called to Lisle.
&#8220;Split the bag, if it&#8217;s necessary, and lower the end!
But be quick! This isn&#8217;t a comfortable position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The pack in which the small bush rancher conveys
his provisions from the nearest store as a rule consists
of a cotton flour bag with a pair of suspenders
fastened to its corners, and Nasmyth had provided the
party with a few receptacles of similar pattern but
more strongly made before entering the wilds. The
straps, when Lisle let them down, reached several feet
from the top, and Batley bade Nasmyth and Crestwick
ascend. They managed it with assistance from
Lisle, who seized them from above. Then Batley
called up to them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to test the tackle. Give me a hand up
as soon as I&#8217;m over the bulge!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was difficult to hear him, as he was still beneath
the projecting edge, and they watched the straining
straps with keen anxiety until a hand that felt for a
hold upon the rock appeared. Lisle seized it, with
Nasmyth ready to assist, and Batley came up, gasping,
with the perspiration streaming from his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have managed it easily at one time,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;This is what comes of civilization and soft living.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You brought us across; we owe you a good deal
for it,&#8221; declared Lisle.
</p>
<p>Batley smiled at him as they set off again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case, I won&#8217;t be an exacting creditor. In
fact, it&#8217;s rather curious how we&#8217;ve hit it off, considering
that you wouldn&#8217;t hear of a compromise and our
interests are opposed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what your interests are,&#8221; Lisle returned
dryly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, in one way, I&#8217;m ahead of you. I know
your wishes, and Nasmyth&#8217;s&mdash;you don&#8217;t want Clarence
to marry Miss Gladwyne. It&#8217;s your motive I&#8217;m
not sure about. Do you want the girl yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were some distance in front of the others, who
were too far behind to hear them. Lisle looked at
his companion steadily. The man was engaged in a
business that was regarded with general disfavor, but
there was something he liked about him and he did
not resent his bluntness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t for the reason you&#8217;ve
given that I mean to stop the match.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you do so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>Batley smiled reflectively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the present journey is somehow connected
with the attempt? Now I believe I might have left
you held up on the wrong side of the cañon; the
idea was in my mind and you can give me credit for
not yielding to it. I suppose there would be no use
in my asking you for a hint as to the relation between
my rather tricky companion&#8217;s expedition and his
cousin&#8217;s death?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None in the least,&#8221; said Lisle decidedly.
</p>
<p>Batley made a gesture of acquiescence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well! We must try to be friends as long as
possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nothing more was said about the matter, and they
spent the day forcing a passage through scrub timber,
up precipitous hillsides, and across long stony ridges.
</p>
<p>There was no sign of Gladwyne&#8217;s trail, but that did
not trouble Lisle, for he knew where the man was
heading for. On the second day Batley showed signs
of distress, and Nasmyth and Crestwick were walking
very wearily, but Lisle held on at a merciless pace.
It was essential that he should reach the cache before
Gladwyne could interfere with it. Toward evening,
Nasmyth made an effort and caught up with Lisle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How would Clarence get across to the second
cache on the other side of the water?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a point I&#8217;ve been considering; I suppose it&#8217;s occurred
to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Lisle confessed. &#8220;The Indians
near the divide said there was another party with canoes
somewhere lower down; but, as the packer who was
with me didn&#8217;t talk to them, so far as I noticed, I
don&#8217;t see how Gladwyne could have heard of it; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
that&#8217;s as far as I can go. If he destroyed the first
cache, it would help to clear him, unless you can
vouch for the correctness of the list I made; but he
may have some further plan in his mind.&#8221; He paused
and raised his hand. &#8220;Listen! Isn&#8217;t that the river?
We can&#8217;t be far from the cache.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The day, like the two or three preceding it, had
been hot and bright, and now that evening was drawing
on, the still air was heavy with the smell of the
cedars in a neighboring hollow. A high ridge stood
out black against a vivid green glow, and from beyond
it there rose a faint, hoarse murmur. Nasmyth
welcomed it gladly as announcing the end of the
march.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest of the party can hardly be down until
to-morrow; there&#8217;s a couple of portages,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It looks as if we&#8217;ll have to go without our supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see them before morning,&#8221; Lisle
returned grimly.
</p>
<p>They pushed on, the light growing dimmer as they
went, until at length the moon rose from behind the
ridge; and when they had skirted the ridge they saw
the river glimmer beneath them in a flood of silvery
radiance. It filled the gorge with its deep murmur,
for the hot sunshine for three days had melted the
snow, which had poured down to swell the flood by
every gully. Not far below the neck the broken surface
was flecked with white where the river swept
angrily over a sharper slope of its bed, and a black
boulder or two stood out in the midst of the rushing
foam. Up-stream of this there was a strip of shingle
which Nasmyth recognized as the one where the cache
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
had been made; he supposed that Lisle had struck
the spot by heading for the narrow rift of the neck,
which was conspicuous for some distance from both
sides.
</p>
<p>From end to end the sweep of pebbles was clearly
distinct; but there was no dark figure moving about
it, and Nasmyth wondered if they had come too late.
They had marched fast, as his aching muscles testified,
but they had been delayed at the cañon and Gladwyne
had had a long start. If he had arrived and
had visited the cache, their efforts might prove to
have been thrown away. There must be no shadow
of doubt when Lisle told his startling story.
</p>
<p>They descended with caution, moving through
shadow, for the ridge above them cut off the moonlight,
though it was far from dark, and they were near
the bottom when Crestwick dislodged a bank of stones
which went rattling and crashing down to the beach.
A moment later a black form sprang out from among
the rocks below and ran hurriedly along the shingle.
This surprised Nasmyth because he could not doubt
that the man was Gladwyne and he failed to understand
his object in making what would probably be
a futile attempt to avoid them. Lisle was some distance
in front, and his voice rang out sharply:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Head him off from the canoe!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth broke into a stumbling run&mdash;it was now
obvious that Gladwyne meant to cross the river, and
perhaps destroy the second cache.
</p>
<p>Gladwyne had reached the canoe when Lisle gained
the beach, and Nasmyth, descending in reckless haste,
saw him hurriedly turn it over and raise the forward
end of it. Lisle was running his hardest, almost as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
if he were fresh, up the long strip of shingle; but it
was evident that he would be too late, and they would
have no means of following Gladwyne after the canoe
was launched. There was a sharp rattle of stones as
he hauled it down; Lisle was still some way behind;
Gladwyne sprang on board and thrust the light craft
off, and a few strokes of the paddle drove her well out
into the stream.
</p>
<p>Lisle stopped, standing in the moonlight, and his
comrade could see his hands tightly clenched at his
side; then he suddenly tore off his jacket and flung it
behind him. Noticing this, Nasmyth attempted to
increase his pace. The river was running fast,
swollen with melted snow, and Lisle must be badly
worn out. If he had to be restrained by force, he
should not attempt to swim across.
</p>
<p>Then, to Nasmyth&#8217;s astonishment, Gladwyne leaned
over the stern of the craft and began to paddle desperately
with one hand. This proceeding caused
Lisle to stop again, close at the water&#8217;s edge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back!&#8221; he shouted.
</p>
<p>Nasmyth ran up and Lisle turned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dropped or broken his paddle&mdash;cracked it
when he shoved her out. There are two or three ugly
rocks in the rapid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They ran along the bank together, keeping pace
with the craft which was sliding away fast with the
stream. Nasmyth could feel his heart thumping as
he wondered what Clarence would do. Though he
could not cross the river, it was possible that he might
propel the light canoe back to the shingle with his hand
before he reached the rapid. As he could not guide
her in the strong rush of water, there would be danger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
in attempting to descend it. He made no response,
however, to their warning shouts.
</p>
<p>Batley and Crestwick overtook the others shortly
before the canoe swept into the faster stream at the
head of the rapid and they watched her eagerly.
There was a narrow pass between several boulders
close ahead, which was the chief danger, and the current
seemed to be carrying the craft down on one of
them. In a few moments she struck and jambed,
broadside on, across the mass of stone. White foam
boiled about her; they saw Gladwyne rise and clutch
the rock, but whether to thrust her off or to climb out
did not appear. He suddenly sank down and, so far
as they could make out, the canoe rolled over.
</p>
<p>The next moment Lisle plunged into the river.
Nasmyth ran to the water&#8217;s edge, but seeing that he
was too late, he sat down limply. Lisle was a good
swimmer, but it did not seem possible that any man
could reach Clarence before he was washed out at the
tail of the rapid. It became evident, however, that
somebody else meant to try, for Batley, running hard
down the beach, plunged in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful!&#8221; gasped Jim Crestwick behind Nasmyth.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not the risk of drowning; they&#8217;ll be
smashed to bits! Anyway, we&#8217;d better make for the
slack at the tail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth got up. He could see nothing of Gladwyne
or either of the others; there were only black
rocks, rushing water and outbreaks of foam, and he
had a sickening idea that long before they reached the
quieter pool the need for any services he could render
would be past. Fortunately, the beach was fairly
smooth, and after a desperate run they reached a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
tongue of rock beneath which the eddy swung.
Farther on, in the shadow, Batley stood in the water,
calling to them and apparently clinging hard to a half-seen
object in the stream.
</p>
<p>Nasmyth leaped in knee-deep, with Crestwick behind
him, and gripping the loosely-hanging arm of
the body Batley was supporting, he asked hoarsely:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lisle!&#8221; was the breathless answer. &#8220;Help me
to get him out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They dragged him up the beach and let him sink
down. He lay upon the shingle, silent and inert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make a fire, Jim!&#8221; commanded Batley. &#8220;Lift his
shoulder a bit, Nasmyth! Turn him partly over!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He hurriedly examined Lisle and then looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a case of drowning; and his limbs look
sound. Must have got the breath knocked out of him
against a boulder.&#8221; He pointed to a broad red gash
on Lisle&#8217;s forehead as Nasmyth eased him down again.
&#8220;That explains his unconsciousness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Gladwyne?&#8221; Nasmyth asked.
</p>
<p>Batley made an expressive gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beyond our help, anyway; somewhere down-river.&#8221;
He appeared to brace himself with an effort.
&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty nearly finished, but there&#8217;s a good deal
to be done. We&#8217;ll strip Lisle, and you and Crestwick
can share your dry things with him. Then one
of you had better gather cedar twigs for him to lie on.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>LISLE GOES TO ENGLAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Lisle had with some difficulty been dressed in
dry clothes, and he lay with his eyes shut on
a couch of cedar sprays beside a fire, when
Batley rose and turned to Nasmyth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we need be anxious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
warmth is coming back to him and he&#8217;s breathing
regularly. The knock on the head must have been
a bad one, and it&#8217;s very likely that he got another
thump or two washing down the rapid, and the water
was icy cold; but he&#8217;ll feel better after a few hours&#8217;
sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth was inclined to agree with this prediction
and he stood up wearily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t want me for a little while,&#8221; he
replied, walking away from the fire.
</p>
<p>Having given most of his clothes to Lisle, he was
very lightly clad and the night was cold. He shivered
as he plodded over the shingle, aching in every
limb, but he looked about eagerly and after a while
he found the cache. It was uncovered, but there were
signs that Gladwyne had only begun his task when he
had been surprised by the arrival of the party which
had followed him.
</p>
<p>Nasmyth did not pause to think what Lisle&#8217;s wishes
might be, or whether he would resent his action. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
far, he had kept his promise; but, with physical weariness
reacting on his mental faculties, he was only
conscious of a hazy idea that Gladwyne&#8217;s death had
released him from his pledge. The traitor had expiated
his offense; the tragic story must never be
raked up again.
</p>
<p>Stooping over the receptacle, he dragged out the
different articles in it, and avoiding a direct glance
at them or any attempt to enumerate them, he gathered
them up and striding over the shingle hurled them as
far as possible into the river. It cost him several
journeys, but his heart grew lighter with every splash.
When at last the work was finished and he had refilled
the hole and scattered the stones that had covered it,
he sat down with a great sense of relief. A burden
which had long weighed upon his mind was gone;
Mrs. Gladwyne and Millicent were safe at last from the
grief and shame that a revelation would have brought
them. Exhausted and confused as he was, he could
not tell whether he felt any sorrow for Gladwyne&#8217;s
tragic end; the man had passed beyond the reach of
human censure, one could only let his memory sink
into oblivion.
</p>
<p>Growing very cold, he went back to the fire, but
he offered no explanation of his absence. Lisle was
still asleep or unconscious, but the natural color in his
face was reassuring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard nothing about your part in the water,&#8221;
Nasmyth said to Batley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much to tell. It isn&#8217;t astonishing
that my memory&#8217;s by no means clear. Anyhow, I
wasn&#8217;t far from Gladwyne, who was swimming well,
when he was swept away from me and in among the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
lower boulders by the swirl of an eddy. I suppose it
didn&#8217;t quite reach me, but the next moment I was
sucked into a rush of broken water and went down-stream,
below the surface part of the time, because I
was surprised when I found I could breathe and look
about again. By good luck, I&#8217;d got into the smoothest,
deepest flow, which swept me straight through. After
a little, I saw somebody washing down in a slack and
got hold of him. I didn&#8217;t know whether it was Gladwyne
or Lisle; but I held on and a side-swing of the
current brought us both ashore. Gladwyne, of course,
must have gone under after being badly damaged
among the rocks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one place where he could have landed
and I searched it while you were away,&#8221; Crestwick said
gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you go in after him?&#8221; Nasmyth asked
Batley. &#8220;You must have seen that you couldn&#8217;t save
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; Batley answered with a curious smile, &#8220;is
more than I can clearly tell you; and I might suggest
that Lisle&#8217;s venture is even harder to understand. I
don&#8217;t honestly think I owe Gladwyne anything; but,
after all, we passed for friends, and I used to be fond
of swimming. Of course, there&#8217;s a more obvious explanation&mdash;I&#8217;d
lent him a good deal of money and
from what I&#8217;ve learned since, I may have some difficulty
in enforcing my claim on the estate. It was
natural that I should make an effort to recover the
debt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth did not think that the man had been most
strongly influenced by that desire, but he addressed
Crestwick:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better gather some more branches or
driftwood for the fire, Jim?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crestwick disappeared, and Nasmyth filled his pipe
before he turned to Batley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be offensive;
but there are two people connected with this affair
who must be spared any unnecessary suffering.
That&#8217;s a fact you had better recognize.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think you do me justice,&#8221; returned
Batley, looking amused. &#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly plain that
there&#8217;s a mystery behind these recent events; one that
has some relation to George Gladwyne&#8217;s death. Your
idea is that an unscrupulous person of my description
might find some profit in probing it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never learn the truth. I&#8217;ve seen to that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, I don&#8217;t mean to try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth was a little astonished at finding himself
ready to believe this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;what do you mean to do about
your claim on Gladwyne?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, there&#8217;s the insurance; but I discovered
by accident that the company Gladwyne had
his policy on was the one that had insured his cousin.
Whether they&#8217;ll be struck by the coincidence and the
unusual nature of both accidents and make trouble or
not, I can&#8217;t tell; but if they pay up there&#8217;ll be an end
of the thing. Failing that, I&#8217;ll have to consider.
My demands might be contested by the Gladwyne
trustees&mdash;the deal was a little irregular in some respects&mdash;but
I parted with the money and I&#8217;m going
to make an effort to get it back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much did Clarence owe you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Batley told him and Nasmyth looked thoughtful.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he requested, &#8220;if you meet with strong
opposition, come to me before you decide on any
course, and I&#8217;ll see what can be arranged. I dare say
there&#8217;ll be some trouble, but I know the trustees&mdash;and,
as I said, there are people who must be saved all
needless pain, at any cost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s promised,&#8221; agreed Batley. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make things
as easy as possible, but that&#8217;s as far as I can go.
I&#8217;m not rich enough to be recklessly generous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle woke soon after this and asked one or two
half-intelligible questions, but they gave him no information
and he went to sleep again; then Crestwick
arrived with more fuel and Nasmyth took the
first watch while his companions rested. He was very
cold, and now and then he saw Batley, who had discarded
most of his wet clothes, wake up for a few
moments and shiver. Once or twice he glanced longingly
at the garments spread out round the fire, but
when he felt them they were still too wet to put on.
After a while Crestwick relieved him, and when he
awakened dawn was breaking across the black ridges
and the rushing river. Batley had left his place, and
Crestwick began to stride up and down the beach,
presumably to warm himself. To Nasmyth&#8217;s satisfaction
and surprise, Lisle spoke to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You slept pretty sound,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t hear
me getting some information about what happened
out of Batley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the grim answer. &#8220;The thing&#8217;s finished;
there&#8217;s nothing to be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth made a sign of agreement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Horribly sore all over, left side particularly.
Struck a big boulder, and then drove in among a nest
of stones before my senses left me. Tried to get up
a while ago, but couldn&#8217;t manage it. What&#8217;s as much
to the purpose, I&#8217;m feeling hungry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, there&#8217;s nothing left for breakfast.
One of us had better go up-stream and look out for the
canoes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your duty&mdash;I don&#8217;t envy you. Make
them camp a little higher up. It would be better, in
several ways, and I&#8217;d rather be on my feet again before
they come here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth set off, jaded and hungry, and he was feeling
very limp when, as he plodded along a high ridge,
he saw the canoes sliding down the river. He had
hard work to reach the bank and he shrank from the
task before him when the first canoe grounded upon
the stones. Millicent and Bella were in it, and Millicent
gazed at the lonely man with fixed, anxious eyes.
He was ragged and looked very weary; his face was
worn and haggard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the rest?&#8221; she asked in a strained voice.
&#8220;Something has happened&mdash;what is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three of them are some miles down the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three!&#8221; cried Millicent, in dismay. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
you found Clarence yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth hesitated, regarding her compassionately,
but she made a sign of protest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on! Don&#8217;t keep me in suspense!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clarence,&#8221; said Nasmyth quietly, &#8220;is dead.
Lisle is rather badly damaged.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Millicent left the canoe and sat down, very white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
in face, upon a neighboring stone. In the meanwhile
the other canoes had grounded and her companions
gathered about her. She did not speak to
them and some time passed before she turned to
Nasmyth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me all,&#8221; she begged.
</p>
<p>He briefly related what had happened, and there
was an impressive silence when he finished. Then
Millicent slowly rose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Lisle&#8217;s badly hurt,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We must
go on!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They relaunched the canoes and Nasmyth had no
further speech with her, for as they floated down-river
she sat, still and silent, in another canoe. She
was conscious chiefly of an unnerving horror and a
sense of contrition. Clarence was dead, and she had
been coldly hypercritical; hardly treating him as a
lover, thinking of his failings. She blamed herself
bitterly in a half-dazed fashion, but it was only afterward
she realized that she had not been troubled by
any very poignant sense of loss.
</p>
<p>After a while Nasmyth said they would land, but
Millicent roused herself to countermand his instructions
and eventually they reached Batley&#8217;s camp.
Lisle had got up during the day and he now walked
painfully down to the water&#8217;s edge to meet her. When
she landed he gravely pressed her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;We did what we
could to save him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know,&#8221; she responded. &#8220;Nobody could
doubt that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Nasmyth landed with provisions and while the
men ate two Indians strode into the camp and addressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
Lisle angrily. They were curing salmon, they
said, and had left a canoe on the shingle, in order to
avoid a portage when returning, and they had gone in
another craft to set some fish-traps in a lower rapid.
To their surprise they had afterward seen their canoe
drifting down-stream full of water and badly damaged,
and they had set off at once to discover who was responsible.
</p>
<p>Lisle offered them some silver currency, and after
a little chaffering they departed satisfied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we know how the canoe came to be lying
where Gladwyne found her,&#8221; he said to Nasmyth.
</p>
<p>Then he sought Millicent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he told her gently, &#8220;we had better go
on&mdash;to stay here would be painful.&#8221; He hesitated.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave Crestwick and an experienced river-Jack
packer to investigate. If you would rather, I&#8217;ll stay
with them, though I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t get about much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she replied in a voice which had a
break in it. &#8220;You must come with us; you don&#8217;t
look fit to stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Running the rapid, they slid away down-river, and
once more Millicent sat very still, thinking confused
thoughts, until at last they made camp for the night
and she crept away to the shelter of her tent. A day
or two later Crestwick and the packer overtook them,
having discovered nothing; and then the party was
animated by a strong desire to escape from the river
and reach the trail to the settlements as soon as possible.
Further search for Gladwyne was useless; the
flood had swept him away and no one would ever
know where his bones lay. He had set out on his
longest and most mysterious journey, leaving only two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
women to mourn him, and of these one, who had tried
to love him out of duty, would by and by forget.
</p>
<p>On the evening before they left the river, Lisle stood
with Millicent looking back up the long reach they
had descended. They had reached the taller timber,
and on one bank black firs, climbing the hillside, stood
out against the fading light with a gauzy mist-curtain
drawn across their higher ranks. The flood slid by,
glimmering dimly, smooth and green, and from out
of the distance came the throbbing clamor of a rapid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your last look,&#8221; said Lisle. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be in the
bush to-morrow and I expect to hire a wagon, or at
least a horse or two, in a few days. Now I&#8217;m sorry
I ever brought you here. You&#8217;ll be glad to get
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t blame yourself,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;We
have only gratitude for you. You have no part in the
painful memories.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She glanced once more up the valley; and then
moved back into the shadow of the firs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all wildly beautiful, but it&#8217;s so pitiless&mdash;I
shall never think of it without a shiver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have made plenty of notes and sketches for
the book,&#8221; suggested Lisle, seeing her distress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The book? I don&#8217;t know that I shall ever finish
it. I feel cut adrift, as if there were no use in working
and I hadn&#8217;t a purpose left. First George went,
and then Clarence&mdash;so far, there was always some
one to think of&mdash;and now I&#8217;m all alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She broke out into open sobbing and Lisle, feeling
very sympathetic and half dismayed, awkwardly tried
to soothe her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m better,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;It was very foolish,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
but I couldn&#8217;t help it. I think we&#8217;ll go back to
the others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave her his arm, for the way was rough, but
as they approached the camp she stopped a moment
amid the shadow and stillness of the great fir trunks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done with the river&mdash;I think I am afraid
of it,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we get away early to-morrow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle said it should be arranged and she turned to
him gratefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One can always rely on you! You&#8217;re just like
George was in many ways. It&#8217;s curious that whenever
I&#8217;m in trouble I think of him&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She seemed on the verge of another breakdown, and
she laid her hand in his for a moment before she went
from him hurriedly with a low, &#8220;Good night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lisle strolled back to the river and lighted his pipe.
He had noticed and thought it significant that she
spoke more of the brother whom she had lost several
years ago than of the lover who had perished recently;
but, from whatever cause it sprung, her distress
troubled him.
</p>
<p>His thoughts were presently interrupted by Nasmyth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a thing I&#8217;d better tell you, Vernon,&#8221; he
said, sitting down near by. &#8220;The night you were half
drowned I emptied the cache and, without making any
note of what was in it, pitched everything into the
river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I discovered. At least, when I managed with
some trouble to reach the place, I knew it was either
you or Gladwyne, and I blamed you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided,&#8221; Lisle said gravely, &#8220;that you did
quite right. It&#8217;s the end of that story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have abandoned the purpose you had in
view?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking hard, and it seems to me that
if Vernon were with me now, the last thing that would
please him would be to see the two women suffer; he
was a big man in every way. There&#8217;s another thing&mdash;he
left no relations to consider.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nasmyth laid a hand on his shoulder in a very expressive
way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt all along that you&#8217;d come to look at it
like that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s Batley; he has some suspicions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can silence him,&#8221; promised Nasmyth. &#8220;The
man has his good points, after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Lisle agreed. &#8220;Still, I&#8217;ll come
straight across to England and tackle him if you fail.
If it&#8217;s a question of money, you can count me in&mdash;I&#8217;ve
been prospering lately.&#8221; He rose and knocked
out his pipe. &#8220;That&#8217;s the last word on the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went back to camp, and starting soon after
sunrise the next morning they reached a settlement
on the railroad after a comparatively easy journey;
and that evening Lisle stood with a heavy heart beside
the track while the big cars moved away, his eyes
fixed on a woman&#8217;s figure that leaned out from a vestibule
platform, waving a hand to him.
</p>
<p>After that he went back to his work, with Crestwick;
and nearly twelve months had passed when he
sent a cable to England and started for that country
a day after receiving the answer. Crestwick insisted
on going with him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll no doubt want my support again,&#8221; he
grinned. &#8220;There&#8217;s an office I mean to rob Nasmyth
of, if I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was evening when they drove into sight of Millicent&#8217;s
house. Lisle&#8217;s heart throbbed painfully fast
as he got down, but he was not kept waiting. Millicent
was standing in her drawing-room, and as he came
in she held out her hand to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You answered my message,&#8221; he said, seizing it.
&#8220;You must have guessed what I meant when I asked
if I might come across.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she confessed softly; &#8220;I knew and I told
you to come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He still held her a little away from him as he gave
a quick glance at the refined and artistic appointments
of the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good deal you will have to give up,&#8221; he
told her. &#8220;You&#8217;re not afraid of our new and rugged
country? But it has something to offer&mdash;and we
need such people as you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a great country before very long,&#8221;
she answered gravely; &#8220;and I have no dread of it now.
But&mdash;I gave my dearest&mdash;I think it owes me something
in return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew her masterfully into his arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It discharges all its debts. You must teach me
how to pay you back in full measure; that&#8217;s my one
big task. You&#8217;re giving so much freely; but, of
course, I&#8217;m glad&mdash;I don&#8217;t want duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t duty,&#8221; she smiled; &#8220;it&#8217;s love!&#8221;
</p>
